-- POPOUT
-- A small panel that DOCKS BESIDE A THING: it picks the side that fits, follows
-- the thing while it moves, and can be pinned loose.
--
-- CONNECTED, then DETACHED. While it FOLLOWS, the popout, the thing and the gap
-- between them are drawn as one object: a 1px accent border on the popout, the
-- same border laid over the source, a small accent diamond -- the connection
-- point -- on the edge the popout docked against, and a short beam across the
-- gap joining the two. PIN it and every one of those goes: pinning is the
-- gesture that says "this is its own window now", and it should look like it.
--
-- Host-bound, like every factory here: `host:CreatePopout(opts)`. The shell
-- knows nothing about what it contains or what closing it MEANS -- the consumer
-- mounts widgets in `build` and decides in `onClose`. Nothing in this file may
-- name a consumer, and it owns no saved state of its own.
--
-- POOLING. Per host+key there is ONE unpinned popout. Asking for a key that
-- already has one hands the same object back, re-targeted, WITHOUT re-running
-- build -- so a popout that opens on every selection costs one frame, not one
-- per selection. Pin() promotes an instance out of the pool (it keeps the
-- content it was built with) and the next request for that key builds a fresh
-- one. `build` is therefore re-runnable by construction: per-instance state
-- belongs on the popout object, never in a file-scope local.
--
-- ⚠ A popout is built HIDDEN. Placement is what presents it -- Follow(region)
-- or PlaceFree(x, y) -- because the entrance pops out of the edge it docks
-- against, and that edge is not known until it has something to dock to.

-- ☠ ONE STRATA ABOVE THE WINDOW, NOT A HIGH LEVEL WITHIN IT.
--
-- In outsideOf mode the beam's crossing segment is drawn over the window's body

-- not merely the window. Two attempts at that stayed inside the window's own

--
--   window level + 10  under the ROW itself (window -> content -> page -> scroll
--                      child -> row -> plate is already +5), and far under the
--                      widgets, which bump their own level off their container
--                      freely -- +10 for a control that has to draw over its
--                      neighbours, +50 for a disabled overlay laid across a group.
--   window level + 60  clears the deepest bump a window is known to make, with
--                      room to spare -- and STILL did not draw. Reported in-game
--                      2026-08-27 with the window at 100% scale, i.e. with the
--                      scale conversion of _SyncWindowScale already ruled out.
--
-- Danders' decisive experiment settled it. With the geometry proven correct (see
-- test_popout's section 16) and the level maths proven correct, the crossing
-- segment never rendered at DIALOG at ANY level -- and beam:SetFrameStrata
-- ("TOOLTIP") rendered it fully and correctly. The occluder was never identified;
-- what is certain is that something within DIALOG outranks any level we can set,
-- and so no arithmetic inside that strata can win. The chrome leaves the strata.
--
-- With the strata boundary doing the work the LEVEL carries none of it -- a
-- boundary is absolute, so nothing in the window's subtree reaches us whatever
-- its level -- and it goes back to being a small constant. Which it must be:
--
-- ⚠ THE WINDOW'S OWN TITLE BAR IS NOT IN THE WINDOW'S STRATA. DandersFrames'
-- settings window is DIALOG, but its title bar sits at FULLSCREEN_DIALOG 200 and
-- its close and info buttons at 210 -- in the very strata the chrome moves up to.
-- The popout must not cover those if the two ever overlap, so the chrome's level
-- has to stay well below 200. 10 leaves that whole gap spare, and still leaves the
-- beam somewhere to sit one level under the popout.
local STACK_BASE = 10

-- ---- the stacking order ------------------------------------------
--
-- ☠ ONE CONSTANT FOR EVERY DOCKED POPOUT WAS THE BUG. Every panel took
-- STACK_BASE, so two overlapping panels were peers -- one strata, one level --
-- and the client was free to interleave THEIR CONTENTS. Reported in-game as
-- "they seem to fight for order and all the settings overlap each other", which
-- is exactly what a tie between two frame subtrees looks like.
--
-- Ordering panels needs an ORDER, so the host keeps one: a list of the popouts
-- currently docked outside a window, oldest first. A popout's level is its PLACE
-- in that list:
--
--     level = STACK_BASE + (slot - 1) * STACK_STRIDE
--
-- A STRIDE, NOT +1, and that is the half that actually stops the interleave. A
-- panel is not one frame: its beam sits one level UNDER it (see
-- _SyncChromeLevel) and everything mounted IN it sits above -- the kit's widgets
-- bump themselves +5 for a hit area or a selection marker and +10 for a tooltip
-- bubble. So each panel owns a BAND, [level - 1 .. level + STACK_STRIDE - 2],
-- and the bands butt up against each other with nothing shared. 16 leaves the
-- deepest of those bumps five levels of air before the next panel's beam.
--
-- RENUMBERED, NOT COUNTED UP. The list is re-walked on every push, raise and
-- close (see reflowStack), so the live set is always slots 1..n and no counter
-- can ratchet: one panel on its own is at exactly STACK_BASE, which is the level
-- a single docked popout has always had.
--
-- STACK_SLOTS is the ceiling, and it is set by the two things above the stack.
-- The top band must stay under the window's own title bar at 200 AND still leave
-- the 50 levels of room a panel's subtree is promised (see the HEADROOM section
-- of test_popout): 10 + 7 * 16 = 122, and 122 + 50 is comfortably clear of 200.
-- Eight simultaneous docked panels means SEVEN PINNED ones, since only ever one
-- is unpinned; past that the newest share the top band rather than climbing into
-- the window's chrome.

-- ---- outside-a-window placement ----------------------------------

-- THE SETTINGS PLACEMENT. A popout about a ROW inside a scrolling WINDOW must not
-- dock beside the row: docked there it lands ON the window, covering the very
-- list the row was picked from, and every scroll drags it across that list. So it
-- docks outside the WINDOW's vertical edge instead, at the ROW's height -- the
-- window stays wholly readable, and the popout still visibly belongs to one row
-- because it is centred on that row and the beam crosses to it.
--
-- Two rects, therefore, not one: the WINDOW decides x (which edge, and how far
-- out), the ROW decides y. Which is also why this cannot be expressed as a frame
-- anchor -- see the clamps below, and _Dock's outsideOf arm.
--
-- Returns side ("right"/"left"), x, y -- the popout's CENTRE, same units as
-- PopoutDockPos, so the dock, the glide's destination and the tests all read one
-- answer. nil for a missing rect.
--
-- ⚠ LEVEL WITH THE ROW, not hung from its top. Hanging from the top is the story
-- right/left docking tells, and for a SHORT popout the two readings agree -- but
-- a tall one hung by its top puts its whole body below the row, so a group with
-- a dozen controls opened from the third row of a list ends up level with the
-- twelfth. "At the row's height" is what this placement promises; the row sits a
-- THIRD down the popout (see the y below), which is what delivers it.
--
-- The clamps, in order (later wins, because being off-screen is worse than being
-- level with the wrong part of the window):
--   1. THE WHOLE POPOUT is clamped into the window's vertical span -- WHEN IT
--      FITS THERE. For a row in view with a popout shorter than the window this
--      is usually a no-op and "centred on the row" holds exactly; for a row
--      scrolled out of the window it is what keeps the popout beside the LIST
--      rather than trailing off after a row that is no longer drawn. A popout
--      TALLER than the window has no position that satisfies the clamp, so it
--      stands down rather than pinning the panel to an arbitrary edge -- the
--      screen clamp below takes it from there.
--   2. The whole popout is clamped fully on screen.

-- ---- the ink rect ------------------------------------------------

-- WHICH PART OF A REGION IS ACTUALLY DRAWN. A region's frame and its INK are not

-- outline laid over the frame is therefore visibly too tall, and a beam aimed at
-- the frame's centre lands below the thing it is pointing at.
--
-- So a region may declare its own inset -- `region.popoutInset = { l, r, t, b }`,
-- pixels trimmed off each edge -- and EVERY rect this file takes of a region
-- honours it. One protocol, read in one place, so the dock, the tether, the clip
-- gate, the beam and the outline cannot end up disagreeing about where a row is.
-- The shell still knows nothing about rows: the region says which part of itself
-- is ink, and the shell believes it.
--
-- ⚠ type(), not a truthiness test. A headless frame stub answers every unknown
-- key with a no-op FUNCTION, so `region.popoutInset` is truthy on frames that
-- have never declared one.

-- ---- the one coordinate space ------------------------------------

-- ☠ A FRAME'S OWN GEOMETRY IS NOT IN UIPARENT UNITS, and every rect in this file
-- is declared to be. GetCenter / GetWidth / GetHeight answer in the frame's OWN
-- coordinate space -- the screen divided by its EFFECTIVE scale -- and a SetPoint
-- offset is read back in that same space. So a region living under a SCALED
-- window and a popout on a scale of its own are measured with two different
-- rulers, and this file compares them constantly: the dock, the beam, the clip
-- gate and the connection point are all differences between the two.
--
-- ⚠ AND THE POPOUT IS ONE OF THE SCALED THINGS NOW. In outsideOf mode it takes
-- the window's scale as its own (see _SyncWindowScale) so its controls match the
-- page's -- so "the popout is at UIParent scale" is no longer the safe reading it
-- once was, and nothing below may assume it. Every one of these three functions
-- already converts, which is exactly why that change needed nothing else.
--
-- The error is not a rounding wobble. It is (distance from UIParent's centre) x
-- (1/scale - 1) on BOTH axes, so out at the edge of a settings window scaled to
-- 85% it is well over a hundred pixels -- which is what the beam's far end
-- stopping dead in the gutter beside its row, and the panel docking a long way
-- clear of the window, both were (in-game, 2026-08-26). DandersFrames' settings
-- window carries a user scale slider; /df popoutdemo's window carries none,
-- which is the whole reason the demo never showed this.
--
-- Note which half was NOT wrong: the source outline is ANCHORED to the region
-- rather than computed from it, so it stayed on the plate throughout. That is
-- exactly the asymmetry the report describes -- the outline lighting the row
-- while the beam pointed at empty space beside it.
--
-- This ratio converts a region's own units to UIParent's. Everything that reads
-- geometry off a frame multiplies by it; everything that hands a number BACK to
-- a frame (a SetPoint offset, a line endpoint) divides by that frame's own.
--
-- ⚠ TEXTURES AND FONTSTRINGS HAVE NO GetEffectiveScale. They are regions, so
-- they answer GetCenter/GetWidth perfectly well -- in their PARENT's space --
-- and `tetherSource` is documented as a region, not as a frame. So walk up to
-- the nearest thing that has one rather than quietly falling back to 1, which

-- ☠☠ FILLS A TABLE THE CALLER OWNS, and that exists because the old shape of this
-- returned a FRESH TABLE and two of its callers are on an OnUpdate. A pinned popout
-- ticks forever by design, and each tick read two rects -- so every pinned popout was
-- allocating two tables a frame, about 120 a second, and four of them about 480. The
-- symptom is memory that climbs fast, gets collected, and immediately climbs again
-- (field report, 2026-09-16: "pin about three or four and it makes the memory rapidly
-- increase"). It reads as a leak and is really pure garbage churn.
-- ⚠ IT SHOWED UP UNDER WHICHEVER ADDON LOADED THE KIT. Popout.lua is in DandersUI's
-- base half, which DandersFrames and DandersMover both load at startup; LibStub keeps
-- the first copy, and WoW bills the allocation to the addon that owns the file the
-- running function came from. So the addon named in the report is bookkeeping, not the
-- culprit -- nothing about the mover was involved.
-- ⚠ THE FIFTEEN COLD CALLERS ARE UNTOUCHED: rectOf still allocates, because they run on
-- a click or a drop and a shared scratch table across them would be a real hazard for no
-- gain. Only the per-frame path opts in, and only because its rects are read straight
-- into scalars and never kept (see _Tick).

-- ============================================================
-- THE FOOTER
-- A strip along the bottom carrying the consumer's `actions` -- verbs about the
-- panel AS A WHOLE, which is why they are not in the content: a control in the
-- column reads as one more setting, and "reset every setting behind this row" is
-- not one of them.
--
-- ☠ THE CONTENT IS PER-ADOPT, NOT PER-BUILD, and that is forced by the pool. One
-- popout instance serves EVERY row on its host (PopoutRow's swapTo re-targets the
-- same object), so the actions belong to whichever row currently has the panel --
-- exactly like the title, the accent and the header toggle. Rendered once at
-- build, row two would be looking at row one's buttons and pressing them would
-- reset row one's settings. So the render runs on every adopt and on every bind,
-- and the BUTTONS are pooled on the instance so re-rendering costs no frames.
--
-- The strip is TRANSPARENT: a 1px rule at its top and nothing else. The rounded
-- surface paints the panel's bottom corners on the FRAME, and a filled strip laid
-- over them -- a child's textures draw above every layer of its parent -- would
-- square them off. A transparent one cannot.
--
-- GREYING. The footer joins the row's OFF GATE (PopoutRow.lua): a row whose
-- toggle is off greys its whole pane, and the footer greys with it. The
-- alternative was to leave it live, and that reads as "this button still does
-- something to a feature that is switched off" -- the same lie the gate exists to
-- stop the pane telling. The popout's own header toggle, pin and cross stay live
-- either way; the footer is body, not chrome.
-- ============================================================

-- One press's worth of state lives on the POPOUT, not on the button, because
-- every way a press can END is something that happens to the panel: it closes,
-- it is swept by its family, its source goes away. See _CancelHold.

-- How deep under the frame the walk below looks. A popout's tree is shallow by
-- construction (frame -> content -> the consumer's mount -> its pane -> a
-- widget's own parts), and a bound rather than an unbounded walk keeps a
-- consumer that parents something enormous into a popout from paying for it.
local CASCADE_DEPTH = 8

-- Repaint the accent-bearing widgets a consumer mounted INSIDE this popout.
--
-- ⚠ The chrome is not the whole panel. SetAccent used to repaint the border, the
-- point, the beam and the source outline and stop there -- so a popout whose
-- accent changed under an open panel ended up a purple-bordered box full of
-- orange sliders. The widgets do not read the popout's colour: they were built
-- against the HOST accent and registered themselves on their parent's
-- `ThemeListeners`, the kit's existing repaint list.
--
-- So the popout walks its own tree, finds those lists and repaints them with ITS
-- colour through `ApplyThemeColor(c)` -- the kit's published "tint to THIS
-- colour" entry point, which sliders, buttons, check boxes and collapse arrows
-- all carry.
--
-- ☠ ApplyThemeColor, NEVER UpdateTheme. UpdateTheme means "repaint to the HOST
-- accent" and takes no arguments -- and it cannot be made to take one, because
-- several call sites in the wild reach it through COLON syntax
-- (`slider:UpdateTheme()`), which would fill that parameter with the widget
-- table itself and paint every channel nil.
--
-- KNOWN LIMIT (gate one): a widget re-tints only if it registered on a
-- ThemeListeners list under this popout AND publishes ApplyThemeColor. A widget
-- built with an explicit opts.accent registers no listener at all, deliberately
-- -- that colour is the call site's choice, not an inherited one. And any
-- repaint that reads host:GetAccent() at CLICK time rather than at theme time (a
-- dropdown menu building its rows, an anchor grid cell re-activating) still
-- comes up in the host colour until it is next rebuilt.
--
-- ☠ A SUBTREE MAY OWN ITS OWN REPAINT -- `frame.dfCascadeInto = fn(c)`, and the
-- walk hands that frame the colour and goes no further down it.
--
-- The reason is the pool, and it is a cost that GROWS. One panel serves every
-- row on a host, and each row's pane is built ONCE and then KEPT under the same
-- mount -- shown or hidden -- for the rest of the session. So the mount's
-- children are every group the user has ever opened, on every page, and a walk
-- rooted above it re-tints all of them on every open. Measured on a 14-row page
-- at 8 controls a row: 226 ApplyThemeColor calls and 292 nodes per open of ONE
-- row, still climbing. That is the stutter.
--
-- A hidden pane does not need the colour AT the moment it changes -- it needs it
-- before it is next SHOWN. So the owner takes the call, repaints the pane that is
-- actually up, and catches the rest up as they come round. The shell keeps the
-- rule (this colour, through ApplyThemeColor) and stops keeping the inventory.

-- thing that clips it. With nothing declared to clip against, the answer is
-- always yes.
--
-- ☠ THE CLIPPER IS NOT THE WINDOW. This used to test against `outsideOf`, and
-- that is the wrong rect by exactly the window's own chrome: a settings window
-- has a title bar, a blurb and its padding ABOVE the viewport, so a row scrolled
-- off the top of the list stops being drawn while its rect still overlaps the
-- window by 50-60px. For that whole stretch the beam, the point and the outline
-- were drawn over the window's own title bar, pointing at a row nobody could
-- see -- chrome hanging in mid-air, which is exactly what it looked like.
--
-- `Follow`'s opts.clipTo names the region that really clips (the scroll frame),
-- and `outsideOf` remains the fallback so an existing caller keeps the old
-- behaviour rather than silently losing the gate.
--
-- Only the CHROME is gated. The popout stays up and stays docked (its y clamps
-- into the window's span, see PopoutOutsidePos) -- scrolling a list must not

-- ---- the source outline ------------------------------------------

-- A 1px accent outline laid over the tether source, so the popout and the thing
-- it is about wear the SAME border and the beam reads as a join between two
-- pieces of one object rather than a line to something unrelated.
--
-- ☠ AND "THE SAME BORDER" IS WHY IT HAS TWO PAINTS. The outline used to be
-- ApplyPixelBorder and nothing else, which is square by construction. Lay that
-- over a ROUNDED row plate and you get the complaint the trial actually
-- produced: a second corner around a selected object -- a hard rectangle traced
-- round a plate that had just been given a curve. The trial's answer was to
-- suppress the outline entirely in rounded mode and let the row's own active
-- ring stand for it; that only worked because the row happened to have one, and
-- it silently dropped the shell's half of the shared-edge story for every other
-- kind of source.
--
-- So the outline follows the SOURCE'S shape instead. A source declares its curve
-- on the tether contract (`region.popoutRadius`, beside the popoutInset it
-- already declares) and a rounded popout tracing a source that declares one
-- draws a rounded RING at that radius; a square source, or a square popout,
-- keeps the pixel border exactly as it shipped. The two are mutually exclusive
-- and each paint takes the other down -- see _PaintSourceOutline.
--
-- Its own frame, parented to the popout's PARENT for the same reason the beam
-- is: a consumer that parents its popouts to a session overlay (so hiding the
-- overlay suspends everything) must get this in that bargain too.

-- The footer STRIP is why it exists. The strip became the tether so the beam
-- would leave the way IN rather than the middle of a plate that may now be
-- three lines tall -- and a strip is square along the top, where it meets the
-- plate's interior, and round along the bottom, where it IS the plate's bottom
-- edge. Neither paint above can draw that: the pixel border traced a hard
-- rectangle round a curved foot, reported in game as "selected rows have hard
-- corners on the bottom, not curved", and a full ring at the plate radius
-- would have rounded the two corners that are supposed to be square.
--
-- ☠ THIS IS THE SOURCE DECLINING, NOT THE SHELL SUPPRESSING, and the
-- difference is the whole of the essay above. The trial's answer -- no outline
-- while the panel is rounded -- guessed on every source's behalf and was right
-- only where the source happened to own an accent ring; it is still refused.
-- Here the strip says so ITSELF, because the strip already draws the shell's
-- half of the shared edge: an accent wash while the panel is open and an accent
-- hairline above it, inside a plate wearing the accent ring. A source that
-- declares nothing is untouched, and so are the beam and the connection point --
-- they say where the panel came from, which is still true.

-- draws a full-surface overlay over its page takes every panel's source under it,
-- and the three things that read _TetherRegion -- the source outline, the beam
-- and the clip gate -- go on describing a rect nobody can see. The outline is the
-- one that shows: it lands on whatever the overlay happens to be drawing in that
-- slot, so it reads as a claim ABOUT THE OVERLAY'S OWN CONTENT. (In game: a spell
-- picker covering the settings content area left an open panel's outline traced
-- round two unrelated rows of the spell list, which read as "these two rows are
-- selected".)
--
-- So the consumer that puts the overlay up says so, and the panels point at the
-- COVERING region for as long as it is there. That is the honest claim -- the
-- overlay is the focus now -- and it keeps outline, beam and clip gate describing
-- ONE rect, which is the contract _TetherRegion exists to hold.
--
-- ONE OVERRIDE, NOT A STACK, and that is deliberate. A consumer's open path can
-- run twice without a close in between (an overlay re-opened for a second context
-- while it is still up), and a stack would then owe two pops where the consumer
-- only ever fires one close -- leaving panels tethered to an overlay that has
