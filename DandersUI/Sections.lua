-- SECTIONS -- the page-composition half of the toolkit.

-- ☠ SHADOW HAZARD -- ALWAYS CALL THE *Native FACTORY NAMES FROM THIS FILE.
-- A consumer may define POSITIONAL CreateSlider / CreateDropdown /
-- CreateAnchorGrid / CreateCheckbox / CreateEditBox / CreateButton / CreateLabel
-- on its own HOST table, which shadows the pack's native factories for that
-- consumer only. A bare `self:CreateLabel` call from library code would then
-- land on the consumer's positional shim, which reads argument 2 as a plain
-- string and argument 3 as a width -- so the opts table is silently mis-parsed
-- and the widget comes back wrong with no error. Every factory here therefore
-- goes through the *Native alias (self:CreateLabelNative(parent, {...})), which
-- nothing shadows.

-- ============================================================
-- THE GROUP'S CONTENT INSET -- one number, two readers
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- How far in from a group's OWN left and right edge its children are laid
-- out. LayoutChildren places against it and GroupInnerWidth measures against
-- it, and the two have to be the SAME expression: a wrapping note is built at
-- the width the helper reports and then re-sized by the layout, so a
-- disagreement shows up as text that wraps at one width and is drawn at
-- another.
--
-- An ordinary group's is simply its padding. A BAND-STYLED one takes a second
-- inset, because its content does not sit on the group -- it sits inside a
-- PLATE, and that plate is itself pulled in by the padding so its edges land
-- on the row plates of the band above it (see the plate's anchoring in
-- LayoutChildren). The second number is the ROW's own padX: a popout row's
-- label is inset from its plate by exactly that, so the box's first control
-- and the row's label share a column instead of the control sitting flush
-- against the plate's border.
local function ContentInsetX(group)
    -- `and` rather than a bare index so a nil group answers the default, and
    -- `or` on the field for the reason the constructor's branches exist: 0 is a
    -- legal inset and Lua reads it as true, so this falls through only on nil.

-- ============================================================
-- THE LAYOUT-HIDDEN CONTRACT
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- A widget can be taken off the page WITHOUT being destroyed, and there are
-- several ways to do it: a section folds, a hideOn flips, a consumer's own page
-- pass shuts a whole box. Every one of them ends in `widget:Hide()`, and Hide
-- says nothing to anything the widget is CONNECTED to.
--
-- Which is how a docked popout got orphaned. The popout is not a child of the
-- row -- it hangs off UIParent so it can draw outside the window -- and neither
-- is the accent outline it traces ON the row. Hide the row and both stayed
-- exactly where they were, over whatever the re-flow moved up into the gap.
--
-- So hiding a widget as part of a layout SAYS SO, and the widget decides what
-- that means. `widget._OnLayoutHidden(widget)` is the whole contract: optional,
-- called only on the transition from shown to hidden, and free for the
-- overwhelming majority of widgets that declare none.
--
-- ⚠ THE CALLERS ARE THE LAYOUTS, NOT THE HIDERS. LayoutChildren below is one
-- (it is where a fold and a hideOn both land); a consumer that runs its own page
-- layout is the other, and reaches this by the published name. Anything that
-- hides a widget for its own reasons -- a drag, a combat suspend -- is not a
-- layout and does not announce one.
--
-- Published as a HOST method so a consumer can call it (`GUI:NotifyLayoutHidden
-- (w)`), and written to take any value at all: the pack's own callers hand it
-- whatever is in a child slot, which on a malformed one is nil.
function UI:NotifyLayoutHidden(widget)
    if type(widget) ~= "table" then return end
    -- rawget, the convention every private-field read in this pack follows: on a
    -- widget that declares none the key is simply absent, and this has to see
    -- that rather than whatever an __index might invent for it.

-- WILL THIS ENTRY BE LAID OUT? THE ONE PREDICATE, and it is file-local rather
-- than a closure inside LayoutChildren because there are now two readers of it:
-- the layout, which PLACES what it answers true for, and CountVisibleChildren,
-- which answers the same question without laying anything out. A copy in the
-- second reader would be a count that drifts from the layout it is describing --
-- which is the whole bug the count exists to fix.
--
-- Three reasons, in the order they are cheapest to ask: a COLLAPSED section
-- shows nothing but its header, the HOST may have marked the child (see
-- SetChildHidden), and the widget carries its own `hideOn`. `layoutDB` is
-- resolved ONCE by the caller and handed in, because a layout asks this per
-- child and the host call behind it is not free.
--
-- `ignoreHostHidden` drops the MIDDLE reason, for a caller that means a group
-- other than the one it is holding -- see CountVisibleChildren. Threaded
-- through the shared predicate rather than forked beside it: a second copy of
-- the collapse and the gate would be a count that drifts from the layout it is
-- describing, which is the whole bug this predicate exists to stop. The layout
-- passes nothing, so nothing about it moves.

    -- band-styled box spans the page like the bands beside it (Danders, on the
    -- converted Frame page: "there is still an issue with their width --
    -- Appearance spans the whole width, the others do not"), and a 280-wide
    -- column of sliders simply stretched to 600 gives five bars twice as long as
    -- any bar needs to be, with the label above each one adrift at the far left.
    -- Two tracks spend the extra width on a SECOND control instead: Frame Width
    -- beside Frame Height, and the plate is full width without a single control
    -- being drawn at a size it was never measured at.
    --
    -- ⚠ ROW-MAJOR, not column-major. Reading order across a pair of related
    -- controls is left-then-right (Width | Height, then Padding | Scale); filling
    -- track one to the bottom first would put Height under Width and pair Width
    -- with whatever happened to be halfway down the list.
    --
    -- A child opts OUT with `widget.fullRow = true` and gets the whole inner
    -- width, which is what a wrapping blurb or a drag list wants. The section
    -- HEADER is opted out for it: it is the group's title, it is the one child a
    -- band-styled box draws outside the plate, and a title occupying half a row

    -- type test rather than an `or` -- `0 or 10` would happen to work in Lua, but
    -- the test says what is meant.
    --
    -- A BAND-STYLED box takes the POPOUT PANE's inset instead of the column's,
    -- because that is the rhythm its neighbours are drawn at: the rows in a band
    -- sit inside a plate that pads them by this much, and a box beside them
    -- padding itself by a different number reads as a second grid. The two
    -- numbers are equal today, so nothing moves -- they are separate tokens
    -- because they answer different questions and only one of them follows the
    -- popout if the popout is ever retuned.
    -- ⚠ Branches, not an `or` chain, for the same reason the type test above is a
    -- type test: 0 is a legal inset, and a chain would silently fall through it.

    -- not need the doubled alpha that made a split edge readable at the cost of
    -- the whole border reading too heavy when it did not split.
    --
    -- opts.chromeless skips the box entirely -- no fill, no border. For a group
    -- that is not a box ON a page but the whole CONTENTS of another surface: a
    -- popout pane already draws its own panel, and a faint bordered rectangle
    -- inside it reads as a second, smaller panel rather than as the panel's
    -- contents.
    --
    -- ⚠ THE BOX FOLLOWS THE CONSUMER'S SURFACE STYLE, and it is the one surface
    -- here that takes it from the HOST rather than from an opt. Every other
    -- shell that can wear either shape is built at a handful of call sites and
    -- can be told; a settings group is built at something over a hundred, on
    -- every page, and threading a style through all of them would mean the ONE
    -- that got missed is the box that stays square in a round window. So the
    -- style is asked for once, here, off the host that declared it -- a consumer
    -- that declared nothing gets exactly the square box it always had.
    --
    -- ☠ THIS SKINS BOTH LAYOUT MODES. The classic (non-container) page layout
    -- and the container one draw the SAME group frame -- they differ in how the
    -- boxes are arranged, not in what a box is -- so rounding it rounds both.
    -- That is the intended reading (the skin is shared chrome, like the header),
    -- but it does mean classic-mode pages change shape without anything on the
    -- classic path being touched.
    --
    -- ===== opts.bandStyle -- THE THIRD SHAPE ==========================
    -- A page that has converted some of its sections into BANDS (a header above
    -- a stack of full-width popout-row plates) and left others inline ends up
    -- speaking two visual languages at once: the bands are header-outside plus
    -- fat plates, the survivors are the classic dense box with its title INSIDE
    -- a faint white rectangle. Danders, on the converted Frame page: "Layout
    -- Direction does not match the Appearance settings."
    --
    -- bandStyle is the survivors' half of that conversion, and it is exactly two
    -- moves -- no widget in the box changes, no factory is swapped:
    --
    --   1. THE TITLE LEAVES THE BOX. The header is still groupChildren[1] and is
    --      still the same CreateHeader the bands use; LayoutChildren simply
    --      starts the plate BELOW it, so the accent title sits on the page at
    --      the same x and the same gap-to-content a band's header does.
    --   2. THE BOX BECOMES A PLATE. Same fill, same border, same R8 at the ROW
    --      weight as a PopoutRow -- read off the row's own tokens, not restated
    --      -- so an inline box and the plates beside it are one surface.
    --
    -- ☠ IT IS A SEPARATE FRAME, NOT THE GROUP'S OWN BACKDROP, and it has to be:
    -- the plate stops short of the group's top edge (that is the whole point),
    -- and a backdrop on the group covers the whole rect by definition. Its level
    -- is pinned to the GROUP's own so it stays under every widget added to the
    -- group -- those land a level above their parent, and a plate left at the
    -- default child level would be a coin flip against them.

-- UI:CreateLink — lean inline text + clickable links in a NOTE style (no box), FIXED layout.
-- The link-capable counterpart to a plain note: same |cCOLOR|Hdata|hText|h|r markup as the
-- InfoBanner (shared ParseHTMLSegments), rendered as flowing dim body text with an accented,
-- hover-lightening Button per link — but WITHOUT the banner's self-resize machinery, so it is
-- safe inside reflowing card containers (no OnSizeChanged -> relayout loop that drops FPS
-- there). Only the link words are clickable/hovered (fixes the old note's whole-frame click).
-- Named CreateLink (not CreateLinkText) so we can grow other link forms.
--
-- opts:
--   onLinkClick(data)  called with the link's raw data string on click.
--   width              wrap width; if given, flows immediately. Omit to flow once when the host
--                      first sizes the frame (then it stops — no re-flow loop).
--   fontTemplate       body font (default DFFontHighlightSmall — the note look).
--   lineHeight         per-line height (default 14).
--   padTop/padBottom   vertical breathing room baked into layoutHeight (default 2 / 8) so a note
--                      isn't glued to the controls above/below it — the measured height (and thus
--                      the slot a caller gives it) already includes it. More below than above so
--                      the note reads as annotating the control above while clearing the next one.
-- Returns the frame; frame.layoutHeight is the measured height after flow; frame:Reflow(w)
