-- ☠ THE SEAM A COMMITTED WRITE HAS TO POKE. A host stamps `RefreshStates` on
-- whatever a control was parented to -- a settings page's scroll child, or the
-- holder behind a popout pane -- and running it is what re-reads the page's
-- grey-out predicates and any row summary drawing this setting. A factory that
-- skips it leaves both stale until something unrelated refreshes.
--
-- ⚠ COMMIT ONLY, NEVER PREVIEW. The slider below writes once per STEP CROSSED
-- while it is dragged and previews once per rendered frame; the whole drag
-- split exists so neither does page-wide work, so this is called from the
-- release, the typed entry and a programmatic set -- never from a drag tick.
--
-- rawget, not a plain read: a headless test frame answers any unset field with
-- a truthy no-op function, so a plain `if parent.RefreshStates` passes for the
-- wrong reason and a test could never see the seam go missing.

-- ============================================================
-- ATTACHING a tooltip to a settings widget — ONE way, for every factory.
--
-- THE RULE: THE HIT AREA IS THE LABEL, and only the label.
--
-- ⚠ This is deliberately NOT the whole widget. A cursor-anchored tooltip then
-- sits on top of the slider or dropdown you are trying to read and operate, and
-- no amount of offsetting it fully solves that, because the thing you point at
-- IS the thing being covered. Reading and adjusting are separate gestures: point
-- at the words to find out what it does, point at the control to use it.
--
-- The label is a FontString and cannot take mouse input, so each widget gets one
-- invisible frame sized to the label's own rect. That also handles a label wider
-- than its container for free (the checkbox case) — the frame follows the TEXT,
-- not the box, so there is no hit-rect arithmetic to keep in sync.
--
-- The anchor is whatever ShowTooltip defaults to — set in ONE place so no page
-- can drift. Nothing here passes an anchor, deliberately.
--
-- The spec is read AT HOVER TIME, not when it is attached — every call site
-- sets it after creation, on the container the factory returned:
--     widget.tooltip = "body"                  title = the widget's own label
--     widget.tooltip = { title=, lines=, tone= }   the full ShowTooltip shape
--     widget.tooltipText / .tooltipSubText     legacy pair, still honoured
-- ============================================================

--   widget       the frame the caller holds and sets .tooltip on (the container)

--   opts         optional:
--                  hit    a FRAME to build the hit over INSTEAD of labelRegion,
--                         for a consumer that hides the caption and draws the
--                         name somewhere else (see below)
--                  noHit  build nothing at all — the consumer owns the hover
--
-- ☠ THE HIT TAKES MOTION, NEVER CLICKS. `EnableMouse(true)` takes both, and a
-- frame that takes clicks sitting over a control eats them -- which is what this
-- helper did for every widget it ever attached to. It went unnoticed while the
-- rect was a VISIBLE caption with nothing behind it, and bit the moment a
-- consumer hid its caption and the rect landed on the control instead. A tooltip
-- needs OnEnter/OnLeave and nothing else, so it asks for motion only and the
-- click falls through to whatever is underneath. That is the fix at the source:
-- it holds whether or not the caller ever sets a tooltip, and whether or not the
-- rect is where the caller thinks it is.
--
-- ⚠ THE HIT IS STILL A HOLE IN A PARENT'S HOVER. Motion is what OnEnter is made
-- of, so a hit frame inside a plate that paints on hover still takes the hover
-- off that plate for as long as the cursor is over it. A consumer whose row
-- owns the hover passes `noHit` and shows the tooltip itself; a consumer that
-- wants one passes `hit` and picks a region where the hole costs least.

-- ============================================================
-- A FOLDER TAB -- A TAB THAT BELONGS TO THE PANEL UNDER IT
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- StyleButton's `tab = true` draws the kit's UNDERLINE tab: a transparent cell
-- with an accent stripe along its bottom. That is the right shape for a strip
-- that switches which VIEW of a page you are looking at, and it is what the
-- designers' Effects / Layout Groups / Global strip wears.
--
-- This is the other kind. A folder tab sits directly ON TOP of a panel and says
-- what that panel is SHOWING, so it has to read as part of it: the selected tab
-- is the same fill as the panel, joined to it with no seam, carrying the accent
-- along its top edge, and the ones that are not selected are set BACK -- shorter,
-- outlined, dim-labelled, so they read as sheets behind the front one. That is a
-- different sentence from an underline tab, and the two can then stand on the
-- same page without reading as "tabs inside tabs", which is the complaint that
-- produced this helper.
--
-- ☠ "SET BACK" IS NOT "DARKER", AND ON A DARK GROUND IT CANNOT BE. Work the
-- composites out over the ground these actually stand on -- a consumer's content
-- panel, C_PANEL at 0.3 over C_BACKGROUND at 0.95, about 0.089:
--
--     page ground                             0.089
--     selected == panel   C_PANEL  @ 0.80  -> 0.114
--     unselected          C_ELEMENT@ 0.85  -> 0.166
--
-- The selected tab's fill is PINNED to the panel's by the join, and the panel is
-- only 0.025 above the ground. So "unselected sits between the ground and the
-- panel" is a 0.025-wide window: any value in it is invisible, and anything below
-- the ground is near-black. There is no legible third step underneath. The
-- unselected tab therefore sits ABOVE the panel, exactly where a dark-theme
-- editor puts an inactive tab, and the front sheet is marked by the ACCENT rather
-- than by being the brightest thing in the strip. Height, label brightness and
-- that accent carry "selected"; fill luminance cannot and was never going to.
--
-- ☠ THE SELECTED TAB HAS NO RING, and that is the whole of "joined". A ring is
-- a closed loop -- the baked `top` shape rounds the two upper corners but still
-- strokes all four sides -- so a selected tab wearing one draws a 1px line along
-- exactly the edge that is supposed to have disappeared into the panel. This is
-- the same bargain UI:ApplyRoundedStrip already strikes for a popout's title
-- strip (`border = false`), and for the same reason: a top-rounded piece that
-- joins something below it is a FILL, not a box.
--
-- ⚠ NO HIGHLIGHT TEXTURE, either. The native HIGHLIGHT layer is a rectangle and
-- would paint square corners back over the two arcs on every mouseover. Hover is
-- a fill/label lift applied through the surface instead, which follows the shape.
--
-- ⚠ HONEST LIMIT, UNVERIFIED IN GAME. The tab drops its OWN bottom edge, but a
-- bordered panel underneath still draws its own top edge, so a hairline may
-- remain along the join. Covering it needs either a 1px patch painted in the
-- panel's fill -- which is translucent, so it lightens the line rather than
-- removing it -- or raising this strip above the panel's frame level so the patch
-- wins, which is sibling draw-order guesswork that cannot be checked headlessly.
-- Neither was taken. If the join reads as a line in game, the fix belongs on the
-- PANEL (drop its top edge under a joined strip), not here.

-- ============================================================
-- A GROUP'S SELECTION MARKER
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- ONE accent bar for a whole group of tabs or nav rows, which GLIDES from the
-- member that was selected to the one that now is -- in place of a per-member
-- stripe that blinks off here and on there.
--
-- Why a shared bar and not N stripes, beyond the motion: two textures switching
-- in the same frame is a pair that has to be synchronised, and Lua cannot
-- observe which of the two changes the client lands first. That is the same
-- argument the settings nav's single hover PLATE was built on. A bar that only
-- ever moves has no pair, so no frame can show two markers or none.
--
-- opts:
--   axis       "x" -- an UNDERLINE spanning the member's bottom edge (a row of
--              mode tabs), or "y" -- a RAIL down its left edge (a list of nav
--              rows). Default "x".
--   thickness  the bar's short dimension. Default 3, matching the tab stripe
--              StyleButton draws when a group does NOT share one of these.
--   duration   the glide, in seconds. Default 0.12.
--   color      the resting colour; SetTo's own colour argument wins per call.
--
-- Parented to the group's CONTAINER, never to a member: it has to be able to sit
-- BETWEEN two members mid-glide, and it has to outlive any one of them being
-- re-anchored by a relayout.
--
-- marker:SetTo(target, color, instant)   glide onto `target`; nil clears it
-- marker:Clear()                         hide it (the next SetTo is instant)
-- marker:ClearIf(target)                 hide it only if it marks `target`
-- marker:GetOwner()                      the member it currently marks, or nil
--
-- ⚠ INSTANT UNLESS BOTH ENDS ARE VISIBLE. A marker with no previous member, one
-- whose previous member has since been hidden (a collapsed nav category), or one
-- that is not itself on screen, has nowhere to glide FROM -- it would sweep in
-- from a stale position, which reads worse than the blink it replaces. Passing
-- `instant` forces the same, and that is what a window that is not shown yet
-- should pass.

-- ============================================================
-- THE MODIFIED-DEFAULT DOT
-- A SECOND indicator kind, and it answers a different question from the star
-- above. The star compares the stored value against the auto-layout GLOBAL; the
-- dot compares it against the value the addon SHIPS. Either can be up without
-- the other, and on a raid control both can be up at once -- which is why they
-- are drawn on opposite sides of the widget, at different sizes, in different
-- colours.
--
-- WHERE IT GOES, AND WHY NOT BESIDE THE STAR. The star and the red reset button
-- own the container's TOP-RIGHT and read as one cluster. A third glyph there
-- would join that cluster visually while meaning something unrelated to it, and
-- on a control with all three up nobody could say which was which. So the dot
-- sits at the END OF THE LABEL'S VISIBLE TEXT: it belongs to the NAME of the
-- setting the way a modified-mark belongs beside a filename. 6px against the
-- star's 12, because it is information, not a control -- no tooltip, no click,
-- no hit frame.
--
-- ⚠ RE-ANCHORED ON EVERY UPDATE, not once at build. The offset is the label's
-- STRING WIDTH, which is not known until the text has been laid out and changes
-- again whenever the settings font does; a build-time anchor would pin the dot
-- to whatever the width happened to be on the frame the widget was created in.
--
-- ⚠ THE LABEL IT HANGS OFF IS OVERRIDABLE, and it has to be. A consumer that
-- HIDES the control's own caption and draws the setting's name itself -- the
-- popout row's hoisted cell -- left this anchored to a rect nobody can see, and
-- the dot came down on the WORDS of whatever was drawn over that rect. Setting
-- `container.modifiedDotLabel` re-points it at the FontString the user is
-- actually reading. Absent on every other control, which is every other control
-- unchanged.
--
-- ⚠ ...AND THE OFFSET MAY BE CAPPED, by `container.modifiedDotMaxX`. The offset
-- is a STRING WIDTH, and GetStringWidth measures the WHOLE string -- so a name
-- stretched across a fixed cell to truncate still measures its untruncated self
-- and the dot walks out of the cell to the right. The cap is the consumer's
-- number because only the consumer knows the rect the dot has to stay inside;
-- the kit only knows to obey it.
--
-- ⚠ AND IT DISPLACES THE "(Global: x)" TEXT. That text anchors to the label's
-- ANCHOR right edge. For a label pinned only on its left (a slider's, a
-- dropdown's) that edge IS the end of the text -- exactly where the dot now
-- sits -- so the two would overlap in the raid editing state. When the dot is up
-- the global text starts after the DOT instead. A stretched label (a checkbox's,
-- pinned to both container edges) never collided, and moving its global text in
-- beside the dot rather than out at the container edge is an improvement, not a
-- change of meaning.

-- single control rather than two loose buttons. Use it for short
-- mutually-exclusive values that want to sit next to the field
-- they qualify (s / %).
--
-- API: GUI:CreateSegmentToggle(parent, segments, dbTable, dbKey, callback, opts)
--   segments : ordered { value =, label =, tooltip = } — label is what
--              shows on the button, tooltip the full name behind a terse one
--   opts.segmentWidth (26) / opts.height (18)
--   opts.fallbackValue : treated as selected when the stored value matches
--              no segment, so an unset key still lights the right button
--   opts.customGet / opts.customSet : same convention as CreateCheckbox /
--              CreateSlider / CreateDropdown — for a toggle over TRANSIENT UI
--              state (or one with its own save path) rather than a db key. Pass

-- PREVIEW vs COMMIT -- the two halves of a drag, and which opt is which.
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- A drag is a stream of values the user is still choosing between, ending in
-- ONE value they chose. Those are different events and they get different
-- callbacks (the same split Cell draws between its onValueChangedFn and
-- afterValueChangedFn):
--
--   opts.lightweight   PREVIEW. Runs only while the bar is being dragged, at
--                      most once per rendered frame, and only when the snapped
--                      value actually moved. Make it cheap and make it about
--                      the one property the slider changes.
--   opts.onChanged     COMMIT. Runs ONCE, on release -- and once on a typed
--                      value in the box. NEVER per drag tick.
--
-- The db write is NOT part of that split: the bound value is written on every
-- tick, exactly as before, so anything that reads the setting mid-drag sees the
-- live number. Only the WORK moves.
--
-- ⚠ A slider with no `lightweight` previews NOTHING during a drag except its own
-- value readout. It does not fall back to onChanged or to the refresh hook --
-- a per-tick full settings sweep is the cost this split exists to remove. Give
-- a slider a lightweight if its drag should be visible.
--
-- ⚠ The whole split needs a host that publishes `onDragStart`. A host without
-- one (a consumer that does not care about drag cost) gets the older behaviour
-- unchanged: refresh + onChanged on every value change.
--
-- opts:
--   label                       min, max, step        REQUIRED
--   get() -> value / set(value) the value binding; omit both for a read-only bar
--   onChanged()                 COMMIT callback -- release and typed entry only
--   lightweight()               PREVIEW callback -- per rendered frame, drag only
--   previewMode                 DEPRECATED and consumed by nothing. Still passed
--                               through to hooks.onDragStart for signature
--                               compatibility; deleted next minor. Do not add
--                               new call sites.
--   accent {r,g,b}              pinned accent instead of the host one
--   tooltip                     stamped onto the container and read at hover time
--   tooltipHit  <frame>         build the hover hit over THIS frame instead of
--                               over the caption -- for a caller that hides the
--                               caption and draws the name itself
--   noTooltipHit                build no hover hit at all; the caller owns it
--   dbRef = { db, key }         optional settings metadata. A slider WITHOUT it
--                               never calls getOverrideState / interceptWrite /
--                               onSettingWritten / registerSearch, so a consumer
--                               with no settings hooks gets a plain slider and
--                               none of the indicator machinery.

    -- THE DRAG BUBBLE

    -- 0.05-step bar has.
    --
    -- Why it is worth having when the box already shows the value: the box is at
    -- the far RIGHT of the row and the thumb can be anywhere along it, so reading
    -- a drag means looking away from what you are doing. The bubble puts the
    -- number where the eye already is.
    --
    -- ⚠ BUILT ON THE FIRST DRAG, not at construction. A settings page is hundreds
    -- of rows and almost none of them are ever dragged; a bubble per slider up
    -- front is a frame and a font string each for nothing.
    --
    -- ⚠ NEVER TAKES THE MOUSE. It sits directly over the bar being dragged, so
    -- mouse input on it would be input stolen from the gesture that summoned it.
    --
    -- ⚠ FIXED WIDTH, sized once to the widest value the bar can show. WoW has no
    -- tabular-figure font object, so digits are NOT equal width and a box that
    -- fitted its text would breathe in and out on every tick -- far more
    -- distracting than the number it is showing. A fixed box with centred text is
    -- the achievable half of tabular numbers.
    --
    -- `lastText` is the string the font string is currently holding, kept in step
    -- with it from the moment it is first written, and compared before every
    -- write: SetText re-measures and re-lays a font string whether or not the
    -- characters changed, and a slow drag on a wide bar spends most of its ticks
    -- on the same snapped value.

    -- dragged through the middle of its range, costs ZERO anchor calls per tick.
    --
    -- ☠ THIS IS THE JITTER FIX, AND RE-ANCHORING PER TICK IS WHAT IT REPLACES.
    -- The first cut of this recomputed an x off the fill arithmetic and issued
    -- ClearAllPoints + SetPoint on EVERY drag tick. Two costs, both real:
    --   * the bubble is a backdrop frame with a pixel border, so it carries six
    --     anchored regions -- a fill, four border strips and the font string --
    --     and dirtying its rect made the layout engine re-solve all six, inside
    --     the same frame that was already writing the fill and the value box;
    --   * that x was a FLOAT, so the box landed on a fresh sub-pixel offset every
    --     tick and shimmered against the bar it was sitting on top of.
    -- Riding the thumb's own (already snapped, already solved) position removes
    -- both at once, and it is robust to the pixel snapping on the track offsets
    -- in a way a hardcoded -12 could never be.
    --
    -- The CLAMP is all that is left to decide, and it is a three-state machine
    -- rather than a per-tick number: free (on the thumb), or pinned half a box
    -- inside one container edge. Without it a bar at either end pushes half the
    -- box outside the settings group, where the page's scroll frame clips it.
    -- Anchors are only re-issued when the state CHANGES -- twice in a drag that
    -- sweeps the whole bar, never in one that does not reach an end.

-- so a dropdown inside a popout docked off a FULLSCREEN_DIALOG window would be

--
-- TOOLTIP is the only strata above FULLSCREEN_DIALOG, so the check is that one
-- name rather than a ladder. The popout's raise caps there for the same reason.
--
-- Called at creation AND on every open: the opener's strata is not settled at
-- creation, because a pooled popout is raised when it is Follow'd -- long after
-- the widgets inside it were built.
--
-- The level only moves if it has to. A menu is created as a CHILD of its opener
-- and so already outranks it; this is the backstop for one that has ended up
-- level with or under the opener, not a level it is handed every time.

-- floating, which is the exact symptom this registry exists to prevent. Four
-- lines is not worth an addon boundary.
-- ☠ THE ONLY RELIABLE CLOSER, and why the single-slot tracker is not.
-- Every menu is parented to its own dropdown BUTTON, so a tab switch hides it via its
-- ancestor. That fires the menu's OnHide, which clears S.currentOpenDropdown -- but the
-- menu's OWN shown flag was never touched, so returning to that tab re-shows it, now
-- untracked. From then on CloseOpenDropdown() is a no-op against it: it stays floating,
-- overlaps whatever you open next, and only closes if you click its own button
-- (Krathe, 2026-08-09 -- all three dropdown symptoms are this one fault).

-- ancestor-hiding never does. Prefer this over CloseOpenDropdown at every open site.

-- The grouped raid box had "Groups Grow From" (Left/Center/Right) and "Row Order"

-- TOOLTIPS AND BANNER TONES  (moved back from the companion)
-- ============================================================
-- ☠ These once lived in a consumer while HideTooltip sat here -- the pair
-- split across an addon boundary. Live code calls ShowTooltip from surfaces
-- the settings panel does not own, so with the panel unloaded every one of
-- those hovers errored.

-- ============================================================
-- CreateInfoBanner
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- A self-resizing banner with an icon, body text, and a "tone"
-- (info / caution / danger / success) that controls background,
-- border, default text colour, and default icon. ("warning" is a
-- legacy alias of "caution".) Do NOT pass fontTemplate — banners
-- share one font on purpose; only the tone should vary.
--
-- Usage:
--   local banner = UI:CreateInfoBanner(parent, { tone = "caution", text = "..." })
--   Add(banner, banner.layoutHeight, "both")
--
-- Methods on the returned frame:
--   :SetTone(name)                  apply a preset (see TONES below)
--   :SetText(text, optColor)        plain text mode, auto-wraps + auto-resizes
--   :SetHTML(html, onLinkClick)     flow-layout body with clickable link buttons
--   :SetIcon(texture, r, g, b)      icon texture + optional vertex colour
--   :SetIconTexture(path)           icon texture only
--   :SetIconColor(r, g, b)          icon vertex colour only
--
-- The body word-wraps automatically; banner height is recomputed via
-- OnSizeChanged so resizing the GUI (or calling SetText/SetHTML) grows
-- or shrinks the banner to fit. The host page is re-laid out so widgets
-- below the banner reposition.
-- ============================================================
-- Each tone carries FOUR colour roles so all three consumers (banners,
-- inline ToneHex text, and tooltips) stay in sync:
--   bg / border / textColor / icon+iconColor  drive the BANNER box itself.
--   accent                                     is the vivid emphasis colour
--     used for INLINE text (ToneHex) and tooltip titles, read against the
--     dark GUI background rather than the banner's own tinted bg. It is a
--     SEPARATE role from iconColor: e.g. the danger icon is a light warm so
--     the triangle pops on the orange banner, but inline "Warning" text must
--     be a real red to out-rank a caution — deriving one from the other
--     (the original bug) made inline danger paler than caution.

-- Blizzard's own callers only ever pass offsets alongside the _RIGHT / _LEFT
