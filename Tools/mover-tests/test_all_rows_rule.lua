-- ============================================================
-- THE ALL-ROWS RULE -- every settings page, swept in one pass
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- On a converted page every top-level object shares ONE left edge and ONE right
-- edge. There are exactly two shapes that satisfy that, and the sweep's per-page
-- census files pin which shape each SITE took:
--
--   a control row  -- one setting on a popout row's plate, in a band
--                     (DandersUI/ControlRow.lua)
--   a full-width box -- a group that could not convert, built at the BAND's
--                     width and added "both"
--
-- What no page may have any more is the third shape: a 280 box standing beside a
-- full-width band. The band skin (tools.INLINE_BOX) was only ever half an answer
-- to it -- it settles the BORDER and never the EDGE, so a skinned 280 box still
-- starts and ends somewhere nothing else on the page does.
--
-- ☠ THIS FILE IS THE RULE ITSELF, NOT ONE PAGE'S READING OF IT. Each census file
-- already counts its own page's boxes; that catches a regression on a page
-- somebody was editing. This catches the one they were NOT -- a new page, a
-- page's second pass, or a stay-inline box copied forward out of an older file.
--
-- ⚠ THE PAGE LIST COMES FROM THE TOC, NOT FROM A LITERAL HERE. A hardcoded list
-- is a rule that silently stops covering the next page added; the companion's
-- own manifest is the one place that cannot forget one.
--
-- What that buys, and what it does not:
--   ✓ no new-UI mount is left at a column's 280, on ANY page.
--   ✓ the band skin and the chromeless band are only ever asked for at the
--     band's width.
--   ✓ a control row is always mounted into a band, never straight into a column.
--   ✗ nothing about what any individual site SHOULD have become -- that is the
--     per-page censuses' job, and the in-game checklist's.
