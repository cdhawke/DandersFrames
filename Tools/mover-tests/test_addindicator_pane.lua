-- ============================================================
-- THE "+ ADD INDICATOR" PANEL -- DRIVEN, NOT READ
-- DandersFrames_Options/AuraDesigner/UI/Cards.lua  (S.BuildAddIndicatorPane)
-- DandersFrames_Options/AuraDesigner/UI/Rows.lua   (the addMount builder)
-- DandersFrames_Options/GUI/Controls.lua           (PopoutContent)
-- DandersUI/Sections.lua                           (the settings group)
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- This panel shipped opening EMPTY twice, and both diagnoses were about HEIGHT:
-- first that the builder never sized its pane, then that the height it reported
-- was swallowed by a `ready` flag. Neither was the fault, and this file is the
-- reason we now know that -- it drives the REAL builder through the REAL mount
-- into the REAL group and measures what comes out, rather than reading the
-- source and believing it.
--
-- ☠ THE ACTUAL FAULT WAS AN ANCHOR, AND IT IS INVISIBLE TO A HEIGHT TEST.
-- The old flow built every step with a frame that had a width and NO HEIGHT, and
-- pinned every card on it twice:
--
--     card:SetPoint("TOPLEFT", 0, y)
--     card:SetPoint("RIGHT", pane, "RIGHT", 0, 0)
--
-- "RIGHT" is (right edge, VERTICAL MIDDLE), and the vertical middle of a
-- zero-height frame is its TOP edge. So the second anchor pins the card's own
-- mid-height to the top of the step -- against a TOPLEFT that puts its top edge
-- `y` BELOW that same top. Two vertical constraints, and they disagree.
--
-- ⚠ A HEADLESS RUN CANNOT SEE THE MISPLACEMENT: the fake frames record anchors
-- rather than resolving them, so no assertion here can watch an object land in
-- the wrong place. What it CAN pin is the PRECONDITION -- every frame this panel
-- anchors something inside has both of its own dimensions -- which is the
-- invariant the fix restored and which the new panel has to keep.
--
-- ☠ AND THE PANEL IS NOT A WIZARD ANY MORE (spec section 26). Three numbered
-- sections stand on one surface: which aura, how it should show, where. The
-- scope step -- Placed on Frame / Frame-Level / From a Filter -- is exactly what
-- the approved design removes, so this file drives the flat flow end to end:
-- pick a source, pick an effect, pick an anchor, commit, and watch which
-- arguments reach the shared add verb.
-- ============================================================

-- ---- a private kit, so nothing here leaks into the shared suites ----
-- Same arrangement as test_sections_group.lua, and for the same reason: this
-- file loads Sections.lua, and loading it into the SHARED table would swap the
-- object the popout suites' live closures were built from.

-- hover highlight on the button when hovering".

-- slider, which a thumbnail was building by falling through the non-compact arm)
-- and the tiles stayed dead. The preview builds a backdrop, a mock, a border
-- overlay and whatever the effect paints on top; naming them is a list that
-- rots.

-- builder has returned, so a walk run inside it misses exactly the frames drawn
