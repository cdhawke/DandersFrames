-- no NewHost). Popout.lua's own handshake is `NS.__DandersUI`, so that table IS
-- the library as far as it is concerned.
--
-- The runtime shape is: a HOST whose metatable __index is the library, factories
-- called on the host (`self:CreateLabel(...)` inside a `function UI:CreatePopout`
-- body resolves through that __index with self = the host), and everything that
-- differs per consumer -- locale, accent -- read off the host. The fake host
-- below is exactly that, with stub factories standing in for Widgets.lua.

-- it: if it grows, this stub has to grow with it and the honesty of the test
-- goes with it.

-- popout's (which lives at UIParent scale) or handed to a screen anchor.
--
-- Left unconverted, the error is (distance from UIParent's centre) x (1/s - 1),

-- plate, hanging in dead space to the right of it. Reported in-game 2026-08-26,
-- and invisible in /df popoutdemo for the reason it is invisible in every test
-- above -- an unscaled window is the one case where the two spaces agree.
--
-- The scene below is the real one, in the real proportions: a 1000 x 700 window

-- 14. THE FRAME STACK -- where the connected chrome is DRAWN
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- ☠ THE BEAM'S CROSSING SEGMENT IS DRAWN OVER THE WINDOW'S BODY. In outsideOf
-- mode the popout stands outside the window's edge and the beam runs from it, in
-- over that edge, across the window's padding and its page, to a row. Every pixel
-- of that after the dock gap is over something the window owns -- so if the beam
-- is not ABOVE the window's whole subtree, the only part of it that is ever drawn
-- is the short stretch in the gap. Which is precisely what "the beam stops short
-- of the row" looks like, and it is what Danders was still seeing in-game on
-- 2026-08-27 with the window at 100% scale (i.e. with the scale conversion of
-- section 13 already in and ruled out).
--
-- ☠ AND NO LEVEL INSIDE THE WINDOW'S STRATA EVER FIXED IT. Two margins were tried
-- and both were measured off the window while staying in its strata: +10 (under
-- the row itself, which is already window+5 through content -> page -> scroll
-- child -> row -> plate, and far under widgets that bump themselves +10 to draw
-- over a neighbour or +50 for a group's disabled overlay), then +60 (past every
-- bump a window is known to make -- and still not drawn).
--
-- Danders' decisive experiment closed it: geometry proven correct (section 16),
-- level maths proven correct, and beam:SetFrameStrata("TOOLTIP") renders the beam
-- fully and correctly. Something within DIALOG outranks any level we can set, and
-- it was never identified -- so the contract is no longer arithmetic inside the
-- window's strata. THE CHROME TAKES THE STRATA ONE STEP ABOVE THE WINDOW'S, and
-- the level goes back to a small constant because a strata boundary is absolute.
--
-- The constant is not free to grow. The settings window is DIALOG but its OWN
-- title bar is FULLSCREEN_DIALOG 200 and its close/info buttons 210 -- in the very
-- strata the chrome moves up to -- so the chrome has to stay well under 200 or a
-- popout could cover the cross.

--

-- between two places is a STRIDE rather than 1: a panel is not one frame (its
-- beam is a level under it and its widgets bump themselves up to +10 above it),
-- so each one needs a BAND of its own or the interleave comes straight back one

-- 16. A SCALED UIPARENT -- the client's own UI Scale slider
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- ☠ EVERY TEST ABOVE RUNS AT UIParent SCALE 1, and that is not the client most
-- people play. The UI Scale slider in the game's own options puts UIParent at
-- something like 0.9, and from that moment UIParent's OWN coordinate space stops
-- being screen pixels: a 3840-wide screen at 0.9 makes UIParent 4266 units wide,
-- so its centre -- the origin every rect in Popout.lua is stated against -- is at
-- 2133, not 1920.
--
-- That matters because the file's whole contract is a ROUND TRIP through that
-- origin. rectOf SUBTRACTS UIParent:GetCenter() and placeAt (and the beam's
-- SetStartPoint) ADD it back by anchoring to "CENTER of UIParent". If the two
-- halves ever disagreed about which space that centre is in, every number would
-- come out displaced by a CONSTANT while keeping its LENGTH -- a beam of exactly
-- the right length drawn in the wrong place. Nothing above could catch it: at
-- scale 1 UIParent's own units and screen pixels are the same numbers, so a
-- confusion between them is invisible.
--
-- ⚠ THE SCENE BELOW IS THE REAL ONE, from an in-game probe (Danders, 2026-08-27,
-- settings window at 100% GUI scale). Every input is a number read off a live
-- frame, and the expected outputs are the ones the probe read back off the beam.
-- It is here as the REPRO for "the beam does not reach the row plate" -- and what
-- it establishes is that the geometry was never what was wrong: the endpoints the
-- probe found are exactly the endpoints correct geometry produces.
--
-- The control is the DOCK, which was visually RIGHT in the same probe. It makes
-- the identical round trip through the identical origin, so if the origin were
-- displaced the panel would be displaced with it. Asserting both here is what
-- keeps that argument honest rather than rhetorical.

-- perfectly. Each arm therefore takes the other down before it paints.
