# ---- the surface style, taken from the REAL Theme.lua -------------------

# it (Theme.lua is listed before Round.lua and Popout.lua in DandersUI.xml);
# headless, nothing loads the theme half, so without this every suite that
# builds a popout would nil-call on the first adopt.
#
# ☠ THE REAL FUNCTIONS, NOT A COPY OF THEM. Theme.lua loads clean under the shim
# (it declares tables and functions and touches no frame at file scope), so it is
# loaded into a THROWAWAY namespace and exactly four names are lifted across.
# Re-implementing the resolver here would mean a test suite that agrees with a
# stub rather than with the library -- and `false means square, nil means ask the
# host` is precisely the kind of rule that drifts when it is written twice.
#
# The throwaway namespace is what keeps this surgical: Theme.lua also installs
# CreateElementBackdrop, the pixel border, the colour table and the whole box
# model, and every suite below stubs its own versions of those. None of that is
# copied over.

# ⚠ THE PIXEL BORDER IS NOT LIFTED, either half, and the reason is the fake
# frames rather than the functions. FakeUIFrame's metatable answers EVERY unset
# key with a no-op function, so the real HidePixelBorder's `frame._pxBorder`
# comes back truthy and it indexes a function; the real ApplyPixelBorder builds
# textures and re-derives its weight from GetPhysicalScreenSize, which the shim
# does not answer. Both are stubbed instead -- ApplyPixelBorder per suite (each
# wants its own recording), HidePixelBorder here, because the rounded chrome
# helpers call it on every rounded paint and nothing asserts anything about it
# beyond "it was taken down".
ns["__DandersUI"]["HidePixelBorder"] = lua.eval(
    "function(_, frame) if frame then frame._pxHidden = true end return frame end")

# ...and Round.lua, for the same reason and with less ceremony: the popout's
# chrome paint calls UI:RemoveRoundedChrome / RemoveRoundedStrip on EVERY paint,
# square included (each shape has to take the other down -- see _PaintChrome), so
# every suite that builds a popout needs the module present even though none of
# the square ones ever draws a curve. It is a base-manifest file that loads
# before Popout.lua in-game, it declares no frames, and it is idempotent on a
# re-load -- test_round.lua loads it again under its own UI.MEDIA to pin the
# texture paths, and that re-load is what those assertions run against.

# DF host. Lib code must use the *Native aliases. This has shipped twice
# (the popout title label 2026-08-26, the footer buttons 2026-08-27); the grep
# makes a third time a red suite instead of an in-game error.

# the Lua tests load the handful of files they drive and the rest of the addon
# is only ever read as TEXT, so a whole page can be unparseable while every
# assertion here passes. That shipped on 2026-09-15: a mangled string escape in
# FilterRegistry/UI/Options.lua left 18429 assertions green and the Filter
# Designer, the spell picker and everything else in that file gone in game.
