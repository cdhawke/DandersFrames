-- THE POOL TABS -- WHAT THE PREVIEW IS SHOWING
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- ☠ TWO STACKED TAB STRIPS READ AS ONE BLOCK. The pool strip sat directly above
-- Effects / Layout Groups / Global and the pair looked like tabs inside tabs --
-- "so confusion to know that they are tabs within tabs". Hiding the pool in a
-- dropdown solved that and cost the three per-tab tooltips, which were the only
-- place the two axes the pools differ on were written down.
--
-- ☠ SO THE TABS COME BACK, AND MOVE INSTEAD. They go ABOVE the frame preview,
-- which then physically separates them from the sub-tabs: the nesting is solved
-- by distance rather than by hiding, and the tooltips return. They are drawn as
-- FOLDER TABS joined to the preview panel -- the selected one continuous with the
-- panel below it, the rest set back behind it -- so they read as belonging to
-- that preview rather than as a second row of the strip lower down. See
-- GUI:StyleFolderTab, which owns that language.
--
-- ⚠ AND THEY STILL CHOOSE MORE THAN THE PICTURE. The pool decides which effects
-- the list shows and which spec applies, not only what the mock is drawn with; the
-- tabs sit on the canvas because that is where they stop competing with the
-- sub-tabs, not because the canvas is all they touch.

-- THE SCOPE ROW -- WHICH SET AM I EDITING
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- One band, one picker: Spec. The pool used to share it and has gone up to the
-- canvas tabs; what is left is the one "which set am I editing" question with no
-- picture of its own.
--
-- ☠ SPEC DID NOT JOIN THE TEMPLATE ROW, AND THE MEASUREMENT IS WHY. The plan
-- was to fold this band away entirely by putting Spec beside Template on the
-- banner's second row. Two labelled pickers is a smaller sum than the three that
-- were refused before, but not small enough: at the window's 520px MINIMUM the
-- band is ~301px and the preset bar spans it less its 10px insets, so 281px has
-- to carry "Template:" (~45) + "Spec:" (~25) + two caption gaps (14) + the
-- overflow glyph (22) + the gap between the halves (10) -- leaving ~165px for TWO
-- openers, about 82px each. Section 17 of the rework spec called 113px "usable,
-- not comfortable"; 82px shows roughly ten characters of "Auto (Restoration
-- Shaman)", which is not enough to tell one spec's auto-label from another's. It
-- is also WORSE than today, where Spec gets ~118px on a band of its own. So the
-- band stays, and Spec takes the whole of it -- which is the one thing this pass
-- does improve, since the pool leaving gives it ~263px instead of ~156px.
--
-- ⚠ AND SPEC GREYS WHEN THE POOL IS NOT MY BUFFS. Debuffs and Any Buff are
-- shared across specs. The pool tabs are two bands up rather than adjacent now,
-- which is the cost of the move; the greying still fires on the same call.

-- ONE EFFECT'S ROWS

-- ☠ THE EFFECT ITSELF IS EXPAND-ONLY. It is a way in to ten groups, not a group,
-- so a panel on it would be a panel that had to contain ten more -- and the
-- popout system is deliberately ONE level deep. The effect is a collapsible
-- SECTION whose header carries the identity (the spell's own icon, the type
-- badge's label, the anchor or trigger count, the eye and the delete), and the
-- rows in the band under it each own one panel.
--
-- ☠ AND A COLLAPSED EFFECT BUILDS NO ROWS AT ALL. A popout row's pane is built
-- EAGERLY, at page-build time (CreatePopoutPageTools' PopoutContent says why:
-- the settings-search registry is built by re-running every page's builder, so a
-- widget that did not exist until the panel opened would be a widget search can
-- never find). So "a row is cheap because its pane is lazy" is FALSE here -- what
-- is cheap is not adding the rows. That is the same bargain the card layout
-- struck with expandedCards, and it is why this keeps that table rather than
-- letting the section's own fold persist into SavedVariables.

-- The row order per effect type, as a card reads downward: does it show -> where
-- -> how big -> what it looks like -> what is drawn on it -> what changes it over
-- time. It is NOT declared here: it is whatever BuildTypeContent's collect pass
-- returns, which is the SAME branch order the card builds, so the two layouts
-- cannot disagree about which sections an effect has.

-- collapsible SECTION whose header carries the identity -- its name, its
-- one-line summary, the eye and the delete -- and the rows in the band under it
-- each own one panel. The group itself is expand-only for the same reason an
-- effect is: it is a way in to five or ten groups, not a group, and the popout
-- system is deliberately ONE level deep.
--
-- ⚠ THE FOLD STATE IS expandedGroups, NOT collapsedGroups, and Toggle is
-- REPLACED rather than hooked. CreateCollapsibleSection persists its fold under
-- the section's TITLE TEXT, and these titles are USER-TYPED GROUP NAMES -- one
-- permanent profile key per group, forever, which is a schema change smuggled in
-- under "pure re-presentation". The state stays in the same in-memory table the
-- card layout used. Same trap MountEffect documents; the section factory has it
-- by default for anything with a user-derived title.
