-- ============================================================
-- POWER INFUSION HELPER -- THE RECIPE (slice 3a)
-- ============================================================
-- One click adds the helper with ONE signal running -- the burst window. The other two are
-- ticked on afterwards if the user wants them. One click removes the lot.
--
-- ☠ THE EFFECTS ARE THE RECORD. There is no second copy of "which signals are on" kept in
-- settings and reconciled against what is on screen. Each effect carries a mark saying which
-- signal it is, and every question is answered by looking for the mark: is a helper added, is
-- a signal on, which surface is it using. One truth, so nothing can drift out of step
-- with it -- and deleting a helper row by hand from Active Indicators simply unticks that
-- signal, because nothing is left holding a contrary opinion.
--
-- ⚠ WHICH IS WHY REMOVING FORGETS THE COLOURS, and that is the house rule rather than a gap.
-- The Aura Designer keeps a record's settings when its last effect is deleted ONLY for a spell
-- the user picked into the pool themselves; records the addon built for them -- ad-hoc ones,
-- and anything driven by a spell list, which is what the helper uses -- are pruned on the spot.
-- S.CleanupAdHocAura says why: an entry holding nothing is cruft in the profile. Remembering
-- would be an exception carved out of a rule written for exactly this category.
-- Behaviour settings (never-mark, the amplifiers, the gate) are NOT effects, live where every
-- other setting in the addon lives, and persist as they always did. Appearance dies with the
-- effect it belongs to. That line is drawn once and holds in both directions.
--
-- It writes nothing new in kind: ordinary custom filters, ordinary frame-level effects with
-- ordinary condition groups -- the shapes the From a Filter picker produces by hand.
--
-- ☠ THE MARK IS NOT OPTIONAL. `cfg.pihSignal` on each effect is what reaches the
-- engine as `config.dfGate` and makes the effect OURS to the gate -- without it, nothing the
-- recipe creates is gated. (This used to be a synthetic spell id seeded into the filter; see
-- pihEnsureFilter for why that was replaced.)
-- ============================================================

-- ☠ ONE HOLDER FOR THE HELPER'S CONSTANTS, AND THE REASON IS THE 200-LOCAL CEILING.
-- Lua 5.1 allows 200 locals per scope, and this file's main chunk sat at exactly
-- 200/200 -- measured by compiling it with probe locals, not estimated -- so the next
-- file-scope `local` added here by anyone, for any reason, would have been a PARSE
-- error taking the whole Aura Designer down at load. These fifteen cost one slot
-- each; as fields of one table they cost one.
-- ⚠ Still built once at load: nothing here is re-allocated per call.

-- on a surface -- the second would overwrite the first and a signal would vanish.
-- pihCreateSignal refuses that rather than letting it happen quietly. (Burst and the retired
-- Strong signal shared a record; the surface dropdown that SWAPPED them is gone too.)
-- ☠ TWO SIGNALS, AND THE THIRD WAS RETIRED ON PURPOSE. "Big cooldown with a trinket or
-- potion" was the only signal that judged two things at once, which made it the only one that
-- could not be an icon, the only one carrying a condition chain, and the only one that could
-- delete itself when its amplifiers were unticked. The question it answered -- how HARD is this
-- burst -- is now answered by the amplifier icons beside the cooldown ones, which say WHICH
-- extras were pressed rather than merely that some were. One less signal, one less shape, and
-- every panel row reads the same way.
--
-- INFUSED DEFAULTS TO AN ICON. It used to default to a background tint and separately offer its
-- own one-icon layout group -- two mechanisms for one job. The Icon surface does it with the
-- aura's own artwork, positioned where the user drags it, so the group went and the default moved.

-- the white it was created with. The first pass of this recipe did exactly that and shipped a
-- burst window that was white instead of gold; found by reading BuildSpec, not by looking at
-- it, because a white border still looks like a border that works.

-- Localised at call time, not at file scope: the same locale-timing rule the effect-label
-- tables in Groups.lua follow.
--
-- ☠ RESOLVED AT RENDER, NEVER STORED. An earlier version wrote this string onto the
-- effect config as `cfg.label` -- which lives in the PROFILE, so a translated string became
-- saved data. Build the helper on an English client and switch to German: the stored row name
-- stays English forever while the surface dropdown resolves live and shows German, two names
-- for one signal disagreeing on screen. The addon's own rule ("never store L[...] as a db
-- value") says it plainly; caught in Danders' PR review, and it blocked the merge because bad
-- data outlives the fix. `pihSignal` is the stored truth and the label is derived from it.
-- ☠ IT NAMES THE FEATURE, NOT THE TRIGGER. The rows read "PI Helper — Big cooldown - Center -
-- Others Only", and Krathe asked the right question of it: "why? It should just say PI Helper
-- - Icon/Border/Square etc". "Big cooldown" is the TRIGGER, which every helper effect shares
-- and which the Triggers tab is entirely about -- so on an effect row it is a constant
-- printed on every line, taking the space where the row's own identity should be.
-- ⚠ THE TYPE IS ALREADY THERE, AS THE BADGE. Every effect row draws a coloured type badge to
-- the left of its name (Icon, Border, Square...), which is how the designer distinguishes two
-- effects on the same spell. Repeating it in the text would be the same word twice on one row.
-- ⚠ THE SECOND SIGNAL KEEPS ITS OWN NAME, because it is genuinely a different thing and the
-- badge cannot say so. Nothing creates one any more (see pihBuildAddTiles), but existing ones
-- still list and delete, and a row that cannot be told apart from its neighbour is a row
-- somebody deletes the wrong one of.
-- ★★ ...AND THE TWO ICONS DO NEED THEIR NAMES (2026-09-10), which is the one exception the
-- argument above generates rather than contradicts. Krathe: "a placed PI icon should show as
-- PI Helper - PI Icon / Icon / Icons, right now only the last actually shows."
-- ⚠ THE BADGE STOPPED BEING ENOUGH THE DAY BOTH COULD EXIST. It says "Icon" for the
-- Power-Infusion-pinned one and "Icon" for the one showing their cooldown -- so the pair
-- Krathe asked for two changes ago arrives as two rows reading identically, which is the
-- "somebody deletes the wrong one" case the note above is about, now reachable.
-- ⚠ STILL NO SUFFIX ON ANY OTHER TYPE. Border, Square and the rest are each unique on the
-- signal, so the badge does distinguish them and repeating it would be the same word twice
-- on one row. The suffix appears where it disambiguates and nowhere else.
-- ☠ staticSpellID'S PRESENCE IS THE ART, as everywhere else -- there is no second field
-- recording the choice (see P.PIH_SetIconShowsAura). A frame-level cfg carries no `type`,
-- so it can never match this branch; only placed instances do.

-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- THE COOLDOWN-ICON GROUP -- RETIRED (schema 5, 2026-09-09), REBUILT IN P.PIH_AddIconGroup
-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- ☠☠ IT SHIPPED, IT GOT STUCK, AND IT WAS RETIRED -- THIS IS THE RETIREMENT NOTE. The group
-- has since come back on purpose: see the note above P.PIH_AddIconGroup for what changed.
-- The helper used to be able to draw a Filter Group of live cooldown icons, ticked on from
-- a row buried under "Classes and Cooldowns". Krathe, 2026-09-09: "I have stuck PI Helper
-- Cooldown - Icons on my AD despite that not even being an option now for PI helper."
-- ⚠ AND HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE SCOPE, WHICH IS WHY IT WAS NOT MEANT TO COME BACK. The
-- helper's question is "is this player worth infusing", not "which cooldown did they press"
-- -- a board of per-spell icons answers the second question at the price of the first. The
-- effects a user adds now are the AD's own: border, health bar, background, name/health
-- text, square, bar, and an Icon showing POWER INFUSION's artwork or the trigger's own.
-- ⚠ THE FINDERS SURVIVE THE FEATURE ON PURPOSE. pihSweep deletes any group a shipped
-- build left behind and needs to be able to FIND one, and a profile that has never been
-- swept still has one to find.
--
-- The original design note, kept because it is the argument that has to be re-made if
-- anyone proposes this again:
-- ☠ A FOURTH WAY TO SHOW THE SAME SIGNAL, NOT A FOURTH SIGNAL. A placed icon pins
-- max = 1 and shows ONE arbitrary cooldown; a Filter Group shows every matching cooldown the
-- unit has running, one icon each -- the richer read of the burst window, and Danders'
-- recommendation ("build it on merit, not as a fallback"). It is also the gate's native
-- shape: the group builds through AuraContainer:Create with a config-wide candidate set, and
-- buildFilterGroupConfig stamps dfGate from the group's own pihSignal mark -- no new gate
-- code anywhere.
--
-- ⚠ THE COOLDOWN SIGNAL ONLY. Infused draws as a placed Icon rather than a group of
-- its own: one signal, one representation. The amplifier list rides into THIS group through
-- the ticks nested under its icons row.
--
-- The group is ordinary Layout Groups data marked with pihSignal -- the same doctrine as the
-- effects: the marks ARE the record. Hand-deleting it from the Layout Groups tab reads as
-- the tick going off, and nothing is left holding a contrary opinion.
-- Two groups, found by their mark: "burst" is the shared cooldowns/amplifiers row
-- (others-only), "infused" is its own one-icon group -- SEPARATE because one container has
-- ONE caster rule, and infused needs the opposite rule from everything else (own casts
-- allowed; it IS an own cast). User's design, second group session.
-- ☠☠☠ AND THE HELPER'S OWN DATA IS NOT ALWAYS IN THE HELPER'S OWN STORE. READ THIS BEFORE
-- WRITING ANOTHER FINDER.
-- Every PIH_* question in this file reads adDB.otherAuras / adDB.otherLayoutGroups, because
-- that is where the helper's records BELONG -- the pool decides a record's caster filter and
-- the helper watches other people's cooldowns, so Any Buff is the only pool where one can
-- match anything. That is a statement about where they belong. It is not a statement about
-- where they ARE.
--
-- ☠ KRATHE'S PROFILE, READ OUT OF SAVEDVARIABLES 2026-09-09 after he reported the same stuck
-- group for the third time:
--     layoutGroups/HolyPriest       -> EIGHT "PI Helper — Cooldown icons" groups
--     auras/HolyPriest/@custom:cf9  -> one marked icon indicator
--     otherAuras/@custom:cf12       -> one marked icon indicator   (the only one in the
--                                      store every finder in this file looks in)
-- The old icon tick called P.CreateLayoutGroup, which is POOL-ROUTED off S.activeBuffTab, and
-- the panel it lived on was mounted in S.BuildEffectsHeadArea -- drawn on EVERY pool's
-- Effects tab, not only Any Buff, whatever the comment beside it claimed. So ticking it on My
-- Buffs created a group in the SPEC store; the finder then could not see it, reported the
-- icons as off, and the next tick made another one. Eight times.
--
-- ⇒ NOTHING COULD REACH THEM. Not the helper (wrong store), not the Layout Groups tab
-- (VisibleLayoutGroups hides marked groups from every pool that is not the helper's), and not
-- the sweep. A record that no control can see is a record no control can turn off, which is
-- exactly what Krathe was looking at.
--
-- ⇒ SO THE SWEEP HUNTS BY MARK, ACROSS EVERY STORE, and these two walkers are how. The
-- ordinary finders stay narrow on purpose -- they answer "what is the helper showing", and
-- the answer must not include records that cannot work -- but anything CLEANING UP has to
-- look where the data actually went. See [[ad-storage-map]] for the store list itself.

-- ⚠ THE SAME TABLES, NOT COPIES. RefreshPreviewEffects paints from the cfg tables it is
-- given, so sharing them is what keeps this canvas identical to the designer's rather than
-- a second renderer that can drift. It also means a colour picked on a signal row is on the
-- preview the moment the page redraws, with nothing to keep in step.

-- trinket proc and a racial running together, which one the engine hands us is not ours to
-- choose and can change between parses. That is exactly the case the "Also count" ticks make
-- COMMON rather than rare -- racials and trinkets are things people press ALONGSIDE a
-- cooldown, which is what made them "amplifiers" in the first place.
--
-- ⭐ SO THE NARROWING RIDES mutedSpellIDs -- the SAME store the Tracked IDs ticks write, not a
-- parallel one. That is the whole reason this needs no new render concept: the resolver
-- already narrows a placement by its mutes (narrowByPlacementMutes), already handles
-- "everything muted = matches nothing", and the fine-grained per-ID ticks are simply the same
-- setting at maximum resolution. A coarse control and a fine control over one store.
-- ⚠ AND THE TICK IS DERIVED, NEVER STORED. It reads "are ALL the currently-ticked amplifier
-- ids muted on this record", so ticking Racials ON in Triggers later makes it read FALSE by
-- itself -- the new ids are not muted, and the icon really can show them. Storing a boolean
-- would leave the box claiming "ignored" while racials appeared. Same doctrine as the class
-- ticks: the tick reads the list, the click edits the list, nothing in between can disagree.

-- ★★★ THE THREE AMPLIFIER TICKS WRITE A REFERENCE, NOT A COPY (2026-09-10).
--
-- ☠ WHAT THIS FUNCTION USED TO DO, AND WHY IT WAS WRONG. It copied every spell id out of the
-- Trinkets, Potions and Racials lists into our cooldown list, so ticking all three took it
-- from 40 spells to 91 and the same ids existed in two places at once. Krathe: "despite the
-- fact those additional filters link to our actual filters, ticking them on actually just adds
-- those to the PI helper filter, so they are now twice on? this is very confusing."
-- ⇒ Each row has a PENCIL that opens the real list. That promises a reference; the tick made a
-- copy. The row was writing a cheque the mechanism did not cash, and no wording fixes that.
--
-- ★ WHAT REPLACES IT: `f.includes`, read by R:ResolveSelection (see foldIncludes there for why
-- the fold lives in the registry and not in the Aura Designer). Our list stays the 40 class
-- cooldowns -- which is what "Edit Cooldowns" has always claimed to open -- and names the
-- other three rather than swallowing them.
--
-- ⭐ AND A WHOLE HAZARD CLASS GOES WITH THE COPY. Gone: the removal universe, the `everything`
-- parameter's second reader, and yesterday's guard against an amplifier tick deleting a class
-- cooldown that happened to be in one of those lists. None of them were defending against
-- anything real -- they were defending against the copy.
-- ⚠ ALSO GONE: hand-rolling "honour the preset's own ticks". ResolveSelection has always done
-- that for a selected preset (recordSelected calls IsSpellEnabled), so a trinket switched off
-- in the Filter Designer now stops firing here for free rather than by our re-derivation.
--
-- ⚠ NEVER pihEnsureFilter HERE. This runs from a tick, and a tick must not conjure the
-- helper's cooldown list into existence -- that is the enable switch's job.
-- ⚠ WHOLESALE, NOT INCREMENTAL. The whole `includes` table is rebuilt from the three ticks
-- every call, so it cannot drift from them and there is nothing to take back out.
-- ⭐ AND THAT IS WHAT SURVIVES AN IMPORT. R:ImportCustomFilters copies `spells` and `rawIDs`
-- and nothing else, so an imported helper list arrives with no includes at all -- while the
-- three ticks travel in adDB.pihelper with the rest of the profile. The next Triggers build
-- re-derives from them and the references are back, because the ticks are the truth and this
-- table is only ever their shadow.

-- its own config -- so the answer is about the row the badge is on. The sibling term went too:
-- only one signal is creatable now, and one record holds one effect per surface, so "another
-- of OUR signals contends here" is unreachable rather than merely unlikely.

-- ★★★ THE CLASH WARNING, RESTORED TO THE EFFECT CARD (2026-09-09).
--
-- ☠ THE HAZARD IS REAL AND SILENT. Border, name text and health text resolve through
-- pickWinner, which takes ONE winner per surface from config alone and tears every other
-- candidate down -- so a helper border plus one of the user's own borders means one of them
-- simply does not draw, with nothing on screen to say which or why. Health bar and background
-- are MULTI (collectFrameTints renders each on its own container) and cannot clash, which is
-- what PIH_CONTENDED encodes.
--
-- ★ AND ON BORDER THERE IS A WAY TO HAVE BOTH, which is Krathe's own observation
-- (2026-09-09): "with border they can just offset and be able to show two borders like you can
-- with AD anyway?" -- exactly right, and the string has always named it. Ticking "Give this
-- aura its own border" opts that effect OUT of the contest (collectStackedBorders draws it
-- alongside, sorted by priority), so both rings show. The text surfaces have no equivalent
-- opt-out; there the remedy is the Priority slider, which is what their string names.
-- ⚠ SO THE WARNING NAMES A REMEDY THAT STILL EXISTS in both cases -- checked, not assumed:
-- the "own border" checkbox and the Priority slider are both live on the effect card.
--
-- ⚠ IT VANISHES WHEN THE REMEDY IS APPLIED. pihContends runs the REAL candidacy test on our
-- own cfg first, so ticking "own border" on this effect removes the warning from it -- a
-- warning that survives its own fix teaches people to ignore warnings.
-- ⚠ `cfg` IS THE ROW'S OWN CONFIG, not a lookup. See the note above for why that matters.

-- ★★★ THE COOLDOWN-ICON GROUP, BACK ON PURPOSE THIS TIME (2026-09-09).
--
-- ☠☠ READ THE RETIREMENT NOTE ABOVE BEFORE TOUCHING THIS. A version of this group shipped,
-- got stuck on Krathe's frames and took three attempts to delete. Every one of those failures
-- was PLUMBING, not the idea: it was created through the pool-routed CreateLayoutGroup from
-- whatever tab happened to be open (so it landed in the SPEC store, where no finder looked),
-- it was switched on by a tick captioned "Icons" buried under Classes and Cooldowns, and the
-- helper had no Layout Groups tab, so nothing could see or configure it.
-- ⇒ WHAT IS DIFFERENT, point by point, because "we fixed it" is not an argument:
--   · CREATED DIRECTLY INTO adDB.otherLayoutGroups. Not through CreateLayoutGroup, whose
--     store depends on the open tab -- the one line that caused the whole mess.
--   · ADDED BY A TILE in the helper's own add grid, beside the surfaces, so it is a visible
--     choice rather than a side effect of a tick.
--   · CONFIGURABLE: the helper's pool has its Layout Groups sub-tab back, and
--     VisibleLayoutGroups already shows exactly the marked groups there. It can be moved,
--     sized and deleted like any other group.
--   · pihPurgeStrayMarks still exists and still finds a marked group in ANY store, so the
--     recovery path that eventually cleaned up the old one is unchanged.
--
-- ⭐ WHY IT EARNS ITS PLACE: a placed icon is ONE slot and shows one arbitrary match. This
-- shows every cooldown the unit actually has up, one icon each -- which is the answer to
-- "allow it to show multiple icons if they have them up" and was Danders' own recommendation
-- for the feature ("build it on merit, not as a fallback").
-- ⚠ THE NAME IS STORED DATA, raw and never L[] -- the same rule the three filter names
-- follow. A translated string in the profile is a name that changes when the client does.
-- ★ "Icons", NOT "Cooldowns" (2026-09-10). Krathe: "maybe it should be called PI Helper -
-- Icons not cooldowns as it can be trinkets etc too?" -- right, and more so since the group
-- gained its own SHOW block: it can be set to trinkets only, in which case a name saying
-- Cooldowns is not merely vague but wrong. PIH_ICON_GROUP_OLD_NAME is what the rename
-- migration recognises; see sweep step 12 for why it matches on the exact old string.
-- ☠ ONE LOCAL, NOT TWO. This file is at Lua's 200-local ceiling in its main chunk, so the
-- old name a migration has to recognise lives inline in sweep step 12 rather than beside
-- this one -- which is also where it is explained. luac refuses the second local outright.

-- ★★ WHAT IT WATCHES, ON ITS OWN CARD (2026-09-10). Every other group's header carries a
-- filter count, and this one's card deliberately has no Linked Filters block: its list is the
-- cooldown list, which the Triggers tab owns end to end. That left a card saying nothing at
-- all about its contents -- Krathe: "cooldown icons allows for trinkets + the other filters?
-- don't see the option."
-- ⇒ THE ANSWER IS YES, AUTOMATICALLY, and that is the thing to say. The cooldown list NAMES
-- the trinket, potion and racial lists (pihSyncTriggerExtras writes `includes`), so a tick on
-- Triggers reaches these icons with no second control and no way for the two to disagree.
-- ⚠ P.PIH_WatchedCount, not this list's own size -- since the amplifiers stopped being copied
-- in, our list is 40 and the number a user is looking for is the whole watched set.
-- ⚠ COUNTED OVER THE GROUP'S OWN SOURCES, and the wording follows: a group that has been
-- given its own set is no longer reporting "from your Triggers", and a header that said so
-- while the SHOW block underneath disagreed would be the panel contradicting itself one row
-- apart. Following => the Triggers phrasing; overridden => the count alone.

-- ★★★ THE COOLDOWN-ICON GROUP PICKS ITS OWN SOURCES (2026-09-10).
--
-- ⭐ WHY IT IS NOT SIMPLY THE TRIGGERS SET. Krathe: "we should let people toggle cooldowns and
-- the sub filters on/off so they can pick from any of the 4... it might be the case they want
-- to trigger from a trinket but only show a CD etc." Triggers answers WHEN the helper fires;
-- this answers WHAT the row of icons then shows, and those are genuinely different questions
-- once you have both a marker and a row.
--
-- ⚠ ABSENT MEANS FOLLOW, and that is the whole compatibility story. `g.pihSources` unset =>
-- the group links the cooldown list and nothing else, whose own `includes` bring in whatever
-- Triggers has ticked -- exactly what it did before this existed, with no migration.
-- ⚠ SET MEANS SPELT OUT. The moment the user touches one tick the group stops inheriting and
-- names all four itself, with selection.noIncludes so the cooldown list is taken literally
-- rather than dragging its own includes in behind it (see foldIncludes in Registry.lua).
-- Materialised from the EFFECTIVE set, so the first click changes exactly the one thing
-- clicked and the other three keep whatever they were showing a moment earlier.
--
-- ☠ NO FILE-SCOPE TABLE FOR THE FOUR KEYS, and that is not a style choice: this file sits
-- at Lua's 200-local ceiling in its main chunk (see the GetUngroupedIndicators removal, which
-- reclaimed one). A `local PIH_SOURCE_ORDER = {...}` here is a COMPILE ERROR, not a smell --
-- luac says "too many local variables". The order lives in the section builder below, which
-- is its only reader anyway.
--
-- The four as they resolve RIGHT NOW: the stored override, or Triggers' own answer.
-- ⚠ COOLDOWNS IS ALWAYS ON WHEN FOLLOWING. It is the baseline the helper is built around --
-- the class list narrows it, nothing switches it off -- so the inherited answer is `true`,
-- and only an explicit override can drop it.

-- and both become honest.

-- narrowing and still does; a profile with none was not and still is not (an empty list is
-- everyone either way, below). Only an explicit OFF is stored, so there is no defaults entry to
-- keep in step and nothing for a migration to fire on.

-- rebuild (a global default affects ALL indicators) and every read falls back to
-- GLOBAL_DEFAULTS_FALLBACK for keys an older profile is missing.
--
-- ☠ AND IT CARRIES THE DEFAULTS ADAPTER, which is what a popout row on this tab
-- needs before it can say anything true. The diff engine recognises DF.db.party /
-- DF.db.raid BY IDENTITY and answers nil for everything else, so a row handed
-- this proxy without an adapter would have a permanently dark modified tick and a
-- Reset Group that wrote nothing while saying it had -- silently, with no error on
-- either. See DandersFrames/Core/Defaults.lua's header for the contract.
--
-- ☠ GetStored IS A rawget ON THE STORED BLOCK, never a read through this proxy:
-- __index answers with the fallback for an unset key, so an adapter reading back
-- through itself would find every key set and light the whole tab up. Same rule
-- CreateInstanceProxy documents at length (AuraDesigner/UI/Groups.lua).
--
-- ClearKey UNSETS rather than writing the fallback in, because the proxy resolves
-- through GLOBAL_DEFAULTS_FALLBACK anyway -- so a reset leaves the profile
-- FOLLOWING the shipped value instead of pinning it at today's copy of it. The
-- Text Designer's Global tab cannot do this (its widgets bind the stored block
-- directly and would be handed a nil); this one can, because nothing reads the
-- block except through here and the factory's own defaults resolution.
--
-- ⚠ THE BLOCK IS RE-RESOLVED PER ACCESS, not captured once at build. The card
-- layout captured `adDB.defaults` in a local, which was correct only because the
-- page is rebuilt on every mode and preset switch; a row's footer verbs run long
-- after the build that made them.

-- FRAME PREVIEW
-- Mock unit frame with health bar, power bar, name, health %,
-- and 9 anchor point dots for indicator placement
-- ============================================================

-- opts.compact -- the BAND form of this canvas, for the popout layout's single
-- column. The anatomy, the nine anchor dots, the drag targets and RefreshGeometry
-- are all identical; two pieces of standing furniture are not:
--   * the three instruction rows along the bottom become the canvas's TOOLTIP.
--     They are 54px of secondary text, and the band the artifact specified is
--     132px tall: label strip 28 + scale slider 30 + those rows 59 leaves 15px
--     for a 64px-tall mock frame, so the mock would be drawn straight over them.
--   * RefreshGeometry's vertical fit accounts for the label+slider strip, which
--     the split-panel form could ignore because it had 400px of height to spend.
-- Omit opts entirely and this is byte-for-byte the canvas the split panel built.
--
-- ☠ AND THREE KNOBS THAT MAKE IT HOST-AGNOSTIC (designer rework phase 4, when the
-- Text Designer replaced its own inferior copy of this canvas with this one). Every
-- one DEFAULTS to what the Aura Designer has always built, so no AD call site moves:
--   opts.scaleDB    the table the Preview Scale slider's value lives on. AD keeps it
--                   on the designer config; the Text Designer has its own key on its
--                   own preset, and a canvas that wrote AD's would be one designer
--                   silently editing the other's setting.
--   opts.placement  the nine anchor dots, the drag hint and the three drag
--                   instructions -- the machinery for PLACING something on the frame.
--                   ☠ IT WRITES SHARED STATE: P.anchorDots is ONE module-level table
--                   and S.dragHintText ONE state field, so a second canvas building
--                   them re-points AD's own drop targets at the other page's mock.
--                   The settings search builds its registry by re-running EVERY
--                   page's builder, so that is not hypothetical. A host with nothing
--                   to place passes false.
--   opts.unitText   the mock's own name and health strings. A host that draws its
--                   OWN text onto the mock (TextDesigner/Preview.lua) would
--                   otherwise get both, overlapping.
--
-- ☠ AND A FOURTH: opts.thumb, THE ADD PANEL'S PICTURE CARDS. The approved add
-- panel draws each effect choice as a PICTURE of the result, and the only honest
-- picture of "what this does to your frame" is this canvas -- the same green
-- fill, the same missing-health remainder, the same power bar, the same name and
-- health strings, read from the same frameDB. A hand-drawn thumbnail was tried
-- and the verdict was "this looks nothing like one of our frames".
--   opts.thumb   { w = <px>, h = <px> } -- an EXPLICIT box instead of the
--                four-sided anchor the band form uses, for two reasons:
--                  * a frame anchored on four sides has no resolved width until
--                    the layout pass, so RefreshGeometry's fit would run against
--                    a zero and take the early exit -- and a thumbnail has no
--                    OnSizeChanged to rescue it, because the box never changes;
--                  * the panel is a fixed 260px popout, so the box IS a constant.
--                The user's Preview Scale is IGNORED here: a thumbnail is sized
--                to its tile, not to a slider on another page. Everything else
--                (the label strip, the anchor dots, the container chrome) is off
--                -- the tile draws its own frame around this.
-- THE COMPACT CANVAS'S GEOMETRY, in screen pixels, named once because the height
-- verb and the canvas itself must agree exactly -- they are two halves of one
-- sum, and a literal in each is how the frame ends up cut off at the bottom.
--   FURNITURE  the label strip along the top -- the title, and at its far end the
--              scale glyph, both inside one 22px band. It was 52 while the Preview
--              Scale slider stood under the title; the slider is behind the glyph
--              now, so 30px of it came back to the frame
--   PAD        breathing room under the mock
--   DY         how far below the container's centre the mock is nudged, so the
--              free space under the furniture is what it is centred in. 6 rather
--              than 20 for the same reason: there is 30px less to clear
--
-- ☠ THESE THREE ARE THE ONLY PLACE THE NUMBERS LIVE. P.CanvasWantedHeight is
-- built out of them, so changing one here changes the band height that goes with
-- it -- do not re-derive that sum anywhere else.

-- itself against the key -- the same move, for the same reason, as the designers'
-- own record views. Without it, opening the panel after switching template would
-- silently edit the template you had just left.

-- THE SUB-TAB STRIP, PER POOL
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- ★★★ ONE DEFINITION FOR BOTH LAYOUTS (2026-09-09). The split panel builds three buttons in
-- S.mainFrame and the popout page hands its list to GUI:BuildDesignerShell -- two strips, and
-- until now two hardcoded copies of the same three entries.
--
-- ⚠ THE HELPER'S POOL SHOWS TWO, IN THE OTHER ORDER. Krathe, 2026-09-09: "'global' should be
-- Triggers and the first option and Effects should be 2nd with no Layout groups for the PI
-- helper section."
--   · TRIGGERS FIRST, because you cannot sensibly choose how to be told about something you
--     have not yet said you care about.
--   · "Global" IS "Triggers", relabelled -- not a new tab. Every pool's Global tab holds what
--     applies to the whole POOL rather than to one effect, and the helper's roles, classes and
--     cooldown gate are exactly that. Keeping the KEY means SwitchTab, the scroll memory and
--     sixty call sites saying S.SwitchTab("global") need no special case.
--   · NO LAYOUT GROUPS. A layout group is a container of live aura icons; the helper has no
--     per-spell display to arrange, and the one group it used to own is what got stuck on
--     Krathe's frames (see pihSweep step 5). An empty tab that can only be filled with
--     something the feature does not do is a door to the bug that was just closed.
--
-- ⚠ A VERB, NOT A TABLE. Every label is an L[...] lookup -- a table built at load freezes the
-- locale that was live then -- and the list genuinely differs per pool, which is the second
-- reason it cannot be computed once.

-- ── BUILD EFFECTS TAB ──
-- ── THE EFFECTS TAB'S HEAD AREA ──
-- The Add from a Spell / Add from a Filter buttons (the PI Helper's tiles on its pool), the ACTIVE
-- INDICATORS heading, the type chips and the Other
-- Buffs hint. Everything above the list of effects, and nothing of the list.
--
-- ============================================================
-- THE ADD FLOW  (designer rework, section 26)
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- ☠ ONE PANEL, THREE NUMBERED SECTIONS, ALL VISIBLE AT ONCE. This shipped once
-- as a three-step WIZARD -- spell, then a scope (Placed on Frame / Frame-Level /
-- From a Filter), then a type -- and the scope step is precisely what the
-- approved design removes. The taxonomy was the problem, not a list length: with
-- it gone the effects are nine tiles on one surface, and a person can see the
-- whole task before starting it instead of discovering step 3 by finishing
-- step 2.
--
-- ☠ AND THE CHOICES ARE PICTURES, NOT LABELS WITH ART BLOBS. Each tile draws one
-- of the player's OWN frames in miniature -- CreateFramePreview's `thumb` arm,
-- so the same green fill, missing-health remainder, power bar and name/health
-- strings, read from the same frameDB -- with the effect applied to it. An
-- earlier synthetic thumbnail drew a generic unit frame and the verdict was
-- "this looks nothing like one of our frames".
--
-- ⚠ SECTIONS 2 AND 3 START DIMMED, NOT HIDDEN. Showing the shape of the whole
-- task is the point; a section that appears only once you have answered the one
-- above it is a wizard with the seams painted over.
--
-- ⚠ WHY "FROM A FILTER" IS IN SECTION 1 AND NOT A SCOPE. A filter cannot be
-- reached spell-first -- its effect hangs off a whole filter, so a spell picked
-- first would be discarded -- but that is an argument for where the CHOICE OF
-- SOURCE lives, not for restoring a step. Section 1 asks "which aura?", and a
-- filter is a saved answer to exactly that question: one section, one question,
-- two ways to answer it. Choosing a filter dims the tiles a filter cannot drive
-- (the three placed types, and Sound -- the native sound path registers per
-- spell id, so a 600-spell filter would mean 600 registrations).
--
-- ☠ EVERY TILE IS BUILT ONCE. The popout kit builds a pane's contents once and
-- frames cannot be garbage-collected in this client, so nothing here rebuilds on
-- a click: what changes is each tile's STATE. What it costs is nine miniature
-- frames per page build, which is the price of the pictures and is paid
-- deliberately -- the fourteen choice cards this replaces were memoised at up to
-- eleven per panel for the same reason.
--
-- ☠ AND A POOLED PANEL CANNOT READ LIVE STATE IN ITS BUILDER. "Already added" is
-- true or false per tile and changes underneath a panel that is merely closed,
-- so it is re-derived by a `Sync` verb the opener calls -- the same shape as
-- S.BuildFilterChips's SyncActive, and the same bug both designer panels shipped
-- with before it (spec section 23).
-- ============================================================

-- ── THE FLAT EFFECT LIST ──
-- ☠ ONE LIST, NO CLASSIFICATION. The same nine effects the old three scopes
-- (Placed on the Frame / Frame-Level / From a Filter) held between them, with the taxonomy taken off: `mode` is still what the store
-- needs (a placed indicator instance, or a frame-level type config) but it is
-- carried BY the choice rather than asked before it.
--
-- ⚠ NINE, NOT THE DESIGN'S SIX. The drawing lists "Icon | Square | Bar |
-- Recolour | Border | Sound", and "Recolour" is one word standing for FOUR
-- distinct effects with four distinct records -- health bar, background, name
-- text, health text. Collapsing them would either drop three of them or ask a
-- second question, which is the step this panel exists to remove; and a card
-- that is a PICTURE of the result is exactly what makes four of them cheap to
-- tell apart, where four words would not be. Flat is the principle; six was the
-- sketch's shorthand.
--
-- A VERB, not a file-scope table: every label is an L[...] lookup and a table
-- built at load freezes on the locale that was live then.

-- of choices section 3 is moot -- and it just sat there grey, looking broken.

--             caption, and the builder draws an accent outline round it.
--   ANSWERED  normal weight, no outline. It shows what you chose.
--   NA        legible, NOT dimmed to nothing: full alpha, a bright caption and

-- ── THE ACTIVE SECTION'S OUTLINE ──
-- A ring traced round the section awaiting an answer, so "where do I look now"
-- is answerable at a glance. The DRAWING is the kit's -- CreateRoundedSurface
-- with `fill = false` is documented as exactly this, "an outline traced over
-- something that has to stay visible under it" -- so nothing new goes into
-- DandersUI. What is local is the three decisions below, and all three are about
-- THIS pane.
--
-- ☠ 1. IT TAKES NO MOUSE. A slider laid over a tile made the whole picture
-- unclickable, twice (spec section 27), and this frame covers nine tiles, two
-- buttons and a nine-cell grid at once. MakeMouseInert walks it AFTER the
-- surface exists, so anything the surface added is covered too.
--
-- ☠ 2. IT IS RAISED ABOVE THE CONTENT. A texture can never draw over a SIBLING
-- frame whose level is not lower -- draw layer loses to frame level -- and the
-- gutter (see 3) only guarantees the ring clears the controls THIS panel holds
-- today. A tenth tile, a wider button or a rounded corner reaching a pixel
-- further would put a run back under a sibling, and the failure mode is a ring
-- that silently loses a side. Re-asserted in Sync rather than only at build: a
-- popout's frame level is its slot in the stack, and anything levelled once at
-- construction falls behind the first time a second panel opens (spec section
-- 15's standing lesson).
--
-- ☠ 3. IT NEVER OVERHANGS THE PANE. Horizontally it is the pane's own width,
-- flush, and that is not a taste: PopoutRow wraps a pane taller than 60% of the
-- screen in a ScrollFrame of exactly the pane's width, which CLIPS -- and this
-- panel is over that cap already. A ring drawn 4px proud would be whole on a
-- tall screen and shaved on a short one.
--
-- ⚠ SO THE SPACE COMES FROM THE CONTENT, NOT FROM THE RING. The ring cannot
-- grow outwards, so the panel steps inwards: THE GUTTER below insets every
-- control by PANE_GUTTER, and the ring keeps the pane's full width and lands in
-- the space that frees. It shipped flush because there was no gutter to inset
-- into, and its left and right runs sat on the outer tiles' own 1px edges -- "too
-- cramped and too close to the content" (spec section 29).

-- ── THE GUTTER ──
-- ONE number, used four ways: the left inset, the right inset, and the ring's
-- pad above and below. Three sections insetting by different amounts is how a
-- page stops having one left edge, and a ring 6px clear at the sides but 3px
-- clear top and bottom is the same failure turned ninety degrees.
--
-- ⚠ AND 6 IS ARITHMETIC, NOT TASTE. The three tile columns divide the content
-- width exactly only on a MULTIPLE OF 3 (260 - 2G - 2*7 ≡ 0 mod 3 needs G ≡ 0),
-- and 6 is the smallest such inset that is actually a gutter: 3 is what the ring
-- already had above and below and is the amount that was judged cramped, and 0 is
-- what shipped. At 6 the tiles are 78 wide and 3*78 + 14 lands exactly on the
-- right gutter; at 5 they are still 78 and the row stops 2px short of it.

-- to EXCEED the ring's pad, or a shown ring would reach over the heading below
-- it; PANE_GUTTER + 2 is that, derived rather than a literal tuned by hand.
--
-- ⚠ IT IS NOT "SO ADJACENT RINGS CLEAR EACH OTHER", which is what section 28
-- raised it for. Exactly one ring is ever drawn (Sync outlines the section
-- awaiting an answer and no other), so two rings overlapping is unobservable;
-- what the eye can catch is a ring crossing the NEXT SECTION'S CONTENT, and that

-- POWER INFUSION HELPER -- THE SHARED PANEL (priest only)
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- Extracted from the classic Effects head area below so the popout row page can
-- mount the SAME panel inside a popout pane (AuraDesigner/UI/Rows.lua) --
-- the S.BuildAddIndicatorPane pattern. Everything below writes through the
-- layout-agnostic P.PIH_* verbs and asks for a redraw through opts.Refresh,
-- which each layout supplies: the split panel rebuilds its Effects tab, the
-- row page rebuilds itself. Nothing in here may name a tab panel directly.
--   opts.startY  -- the y cursor to build from (negative, parent-relative)
--   opts.Refresh -- "the data moved, redraw this layout's Effects surface"
-- Returns the final y cursor, so the classic arm carries on below the panel
-- and the pane arm sizes its pane from it.
--
-- ⚠ A SEPARATE BLOCK, not a fourth card in the one above. Those three answer "what shape
-- of indicator do you want" and then ask which spell; this one asks nothing and builds a
-- whole configured feature. Putting it beside them would imply it belongs to the same
-- question, and a card that behaves differently from its neighbours is a lying control.
--
-- ☠ The card becomes REMOVE once a helper exists on this preset, so there is one place to
-- look for both. Create and remove are the same feature seen from either side.
-- ⚠ SPLIT INTO PARTS 2026-09-01, ONE DEFINITION STILL. It was split because the popout
-- layout's pane outgrew its page and needed the bodies one row at a time, so the builder
-- became: the CARD on its own (S.BuildPIHelperCard), a shared section toolkit
-- (pihMakeTools), and one body function per section.
-- ⚠ THAT SECOND CONSUMER IS GONE (2026-09-08) -- the helper has its own page and the row
-- band went with the move, taking S.PIHelperSections with it. The split is KEPT anyway: one
-- body per section is what lets the page compose them in a different ORDER (Triggers before
-- Indicators) without touching a single control.
-- ── THE ONE-TIME SWEEP ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- The two-signal shape retired "Big cooldown with a trinket or potion" and moved racials
-- out of the cooldown list. Neither change reaches a helper that already exists: its
-- effects and its spell lists are the user's data, written once and never re-seeded.
--
-- ☠ WHAT GOES WRONG WITHOUT THIS is not a crash but a set of LYING CONTROLS. A
-- retired signal's effect keeps rendering with no row that can turn it off; racials keep
-- lighting the border while the new "Include racials" tick reads as off, because the tick
-- reads the amplifier list and the racials are in the other one; and the infused icon group
-- keeps drawing with no tick left to represent it.
--
-- ⚠ STAMPED, NOT INFERRED. There is no way to tell "already swept" from "the user
-- deliberately put a racial back", so a version stamp decides rather than a heuristic --
-- otherwise the sweep would undo a hand edit on every login.
-- 3: Square retired, migrated to Border. RETRACTED the same afternoon and never shipped --
--    see the note on step 4. The number is burned rather than reused, so a client that ran
--    it is not told it is on a schema it never saw.
-- 4: Icon retired as a helper surface, migrated to Square (step 4 in pihSweep).
-- 5: The cooldown-icon GROUP retired outright, and the amplifier list folded into the one
--    cooldown list the helper matches on (steps 5 and 6). Icon comes BACK as a surface at the
--    same time -- pinned to Power Infusion's own artwork, which is what schema 4's objection
--    was actually about -- but nothing needs migrating for that: schema 4 already turned every
--    existing Icon into a Square, and a square is a perfectly good marker to leave someone on.
-- 6: ☠ SCHEMA 5 STAMPED ITSELF AND DELETED NOTHING. Its group delete searched one store by
--    id; Krathe's eight groups are in another (see pihPurgeStrayMarks). So the stamp says
--    "swept" on profiles that were not, and the version has to move for the fixed step to get
--    a second chance at them. A number is cheap; a stamp that lies is not.
-- 7: Stack Count retired on helper markers. showStacks defaults TRUE for icons and
--    squares, so every helper marker ever created is drawing a count read off whichever
--    cooldown matched -- on an icon whose art is pinned to Power Infusion. New ones are
--    stamped false at creation; step 7 does the ones already out there.
-- 8: ☠ THE CURATED MARK NEVER LANDED ON AN EXISTING PROFILE. dfDefaults is what makes
--    the Filter Designer give our list the on/off tick and the Reset button, and it is
--    stamped by pihEnsureFilter -- which only RUNS when the helper creates or repairs a
--    signal. A helper that already exists and is not being edited never calls it, so
--    Krathe's list still showed the destructive ✕ and no Reset. Shipped and reported in
--    one round: "the seeded list does not have the same toggle on/off as other filters
--    and it does not have a reset option?"
--    ⚠ THE LESSON: a mark written by a CREATE path reaches nobody who already has the
--    thing. Stamping in the sweep is what reaches them, and the sweep is the one place
--    that runs for a helper nobody is touching.

-- Appearance (colour, border style, which surface) stays on the effect rows, because
-- that genuinely differs per signal and is where the AD already puts appearance.
--
-- ☠ INDENTED IN THE CLASSIC TAB, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE INDENT. These
-- boxes used to start at the same left edge as "Add an indicator" and "Active
-- indicators", so a column of five same-level boxes read as five sections rather

-- engine -- so the step is borrowed instead of the mechanism, which at least keeps
-- one indent width in the addon rather than two.

    -- ☠☠ EVERY NOTE IN THESE SECTIONS TAKES AN EXPLICIT HEIGHT, which inverts CreateLabel's
    -- usual advice on purpose -- and getting that inversion wrong cost three rounds of
    -- the user's time, so here is the whole mechanism.
    --
    -- A label builds itself 380px wide, measures, and gets a ONE-LINE answer. The group
    -- then narrows it to the real width and the text wraps to three or four lines. The
    -- label notices and fires a correction -- but only when the call site left the height
    -- alone, and that correction re-flows the GROUP, then asks the COLUMN, which stacks
    -- its children at fixed offsets and does nothing. So the group keeps the one-line
    -- height, the label spills out of its bottom edge, and the next box is drawn on top
    -- of it. That is how the note went "missing" and the boxes overlapped in the same
    -- breath: the same fault, seen from two ends.
    --
    -- ⭐ CreateLabel's own comment names the escape hatch without calling it one: labels
    -- "with a call-site height are exactly the ones nothing else ever touches again". A
    -- pinned height is the ONLY safe kind of note here, because pinning is what stops the
    -- converge that this column cannot absorb.
    --
    -- ⚠ AND MEASURING INSTEAD IS NOT AVAILABLE. CreateLabel's own note records the
    -- attempt: "Do NOT try to Reflow()+Remeasure() synchronously here to get a correct
    -- height at creation. Tried 2026-08-05 and it does not work: nothing has been drawn
    -- yet at card build time, so GetStringHeight still returns 0". So the height has to
    -- be predicted, and the only question is how well.
    --
    -- ⚠ DERIVED FROM THE REAL WIDTH, not a constant. The first version used a flat 38
    -- characters per line "to be safe"; the truth at this panel's width is nearer 68, so
    -- every note claimed twice the lines it needed and left visible gaps above the first
    -- tick and below the last note -- field-reported with a screenshot 2026-08-24.
    -- The per-character width is deliberately a shade wider than the font renders, so the
    -- count errs toward MORE lines, which is the safe direction; and because it reads the
    -- panel width it stays right when the panel is resized, not only at one size. The
    -- measured figure and why it is rounded up are on PIH_NOTE_LINE above.
    -- The byte count makes an em dash worth three, which errs the same way.
    -- Delete all of this the day the column publishes a `dfAD_ReflowWidgets` seam.
    t.noteW = t.groupW - 24
    -- ⭐ 6 PIXELS PER CHARACTER, AND THAT NUMBER WAS MEASURED, NOT PICKED.
    -- It was 8, which is where seven rounds of gaps came from: at a note width of 400 the
    -- panel fits ~74 characters on a line, so 400/74 is about 5.4 -- and reserving for 50
    -- meant every long note claimed half again as many lines as it needed. The big one
    -- asked for 8 lines to hold 5.
    -- ⚠ 6 rather than 5.4 on purpose: it still errs long, by roughly a line on a
    -- paragraph, and that line is the margin a longer translation gets to grow into.
    -- ☠ Do NOT try to verify this from the widget. A probe that dumped every note's
    -- measured height reported 30 for all of them whatever the text, because a pinned
    -- label's frame never grows -- the FontString simply draws past it. The slot IS the
    -- layout here; the frame height is not evidence of anything.
    -- Parameterised on the wrap width, because the checkbox helper below

    -- ☠☠ NOT A BANNER, AND THE REASON IS A RACE RATHER THAN A SIZE.
    -- Six shapes were tried and the symptom alternated between an overlap and a large
    -- gap FROM THE SAME BUILD -- "half the time it's overlap, the other half it's a huge
    -- gap". That is not a wrong constant; a wrong constant is wrong the same way every
    -- time. It is a timing race, and no number can win one.
    --
    -- ⭐ Verified, and the asymmetry is the whole story: AddWidget stamps
    -- `_slotHeightExplicit` when a call site pins a height (DandersUI/Sections.lua).
    -- CreateLabel CHECKS it (GUI/Sections.lua) and skips its re-measure entirely, so a
    -- pinned label is fixed at build and never corrects itself. CreateInfoBanner never
    -- checks it -- its DoRecomputeHeight and TriggerHostRelayout run whatever you passed.
    -- So the box's final height depends on when the panel happened to be built relative
    -- to the banner's TWO measure passes: before it settles, the column reserved too
    -- little and the next group is overlapped; after, the group shrinks under a
    -- reservation already spent and the space becomes a gap.
    --
    -- ⚠ A box therefore cannot be made deterministic from this side. Getting one back
    -- means CreateInfoBanner honouring `_slotHeightExplicit` the way CreateLabel does --
    -- Danders' file, a real request with a checked premise, and NOT the reflow seam we

    -- Each tick creates or deletes one ordinary effect, which is why the signal rows
    -- also appear in Active Indicators: they ARE indicators, and hiding them there
    -- would mean a row you can see the colour of but cannot find.
    -- ── t.signalRow: REMOVED, 2026-09-08 ──
    -- ☠ It was the whole per-signal control: a surface dropdown, a clash warning, a colour
    -- swatch and the icon lists. The Effects tab is the DESIGNER's add flow and effect
    -- cards now (pihBuildEffectsTab), so the first three are drawn by the designer's own
    -- widgets and cannot drift from them -- which is the whole point of the change.
    -- ⚠ THE ICON LISTS SURVIVED THE REMOVAL, deliberately: they moved to pihAddIconLists and
    -- are drawn under Triggers, where they belong -- each tick decides which category of buff
    -- COUNTS, not how anything is drawn. Deleting this function without lifting them would
    -- have quietly removed four of Maelareth's settings (#263) as a side effect of a
    -- layout change.

-- ── THE SECTION BODIES ──
-- Each takes (group, tools) and adds its widgets; which GROUP it lands in is the
-- composition's business -- classic folds several into one box, the row page gives
-- each its own pane.

-- ☠ (Removed) pihAddIntro. Its one sentence -- "choose how the helper shows on your
-- group frames" -- described what two labelled dropdowns and a set of ticks underneath were
-- already saying. The banner-versus-label lesson it carried is not lost: pihAddGateAndNotes
-- below states it, and GUI:RelayoutHost documents the underlying reflow seam.

local function pihAddGateAndNotes(g, t)
    -- ☠ A LABEL, NOT AN INFO BANNER, AND THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THE SAME TRAP HAS
    -- CAUGHT US. A banner starts life 34px tall and measures its real height a frame
    -- after it draws, then asks its host to re-flow. Inside a settings group the
    -- GROUP does re-flow -- which is why putting it in one looked like the fix -- but
    -- the group then asks the COLUMN, and this column publishes no
    -- `dfAD_ReflowWidgets` seam, so every box below it stays where the old height
    -- put it. Four lines of prose starting from a 34px estimate is a big enough jump
    -- to land on the next box: "Trinkets and Potions is being overlapped by What to
    -- Show", field-reported 2026-08-24.
    --
    -- ⚠ THE DIFFERENCE IS THE SIZE OF THE LIE, not the widget. CreateLabel measures
    -- itself too, but it starts at 40px, which already covers the two-line notes
    -- these boxes use -- so its correction is small or zero and nothing visibly
    -- moves. A banner's is not. Until the column grows a reflow seam (raised with
    -- Danders), prose here has to be short enough that its first guess is right.
    --
    -- ⚠ AND THE TEXT SHRANK FOR THE SAME REASON IT COULD AFFORD TO: two of the three
    -- facts it carried are already on screen where they matter. The swap is written
    -- into the dropdown entry itself ("Health Bar (swap with Big cooldown)"), and
    -- the single-winner warning appears, naming the offender, exactly when it
    -- applies. Only the stacking rule had nowhere else to live.
    -- ☠ A TOGGLE, NOT A SPELL PICKER. An earlier pass let the user choose which
    -- cooldown gates the helper. The machinery is not priest-specific so it was
    -- easy -- but nobody asked for it, and "which spell hides this" is a question
    -- about plumbing rather than about the feature. The helper exists to say who is
    -- worth infusing; it hides when you cannot infuse. One idea, one switch.
    -- (The capability stays underneath for testing.)
    --
    -- ⚠ IT SITS HERE RATHER THAN IN A BOX OF ITS OWN. A whole titled group around a
    -- single checkbox is more chrome than the setting is worth, and this label says
    -- what it does without a header to lean on -- which is the test for whether a
    -- control can live under a heading that does not quite describe it.
    -- ⚠ THAT TEST IS STILL MET BY A SHORTER LABEL. "Show even if your Power Infusion is on
    -- cooldown" spelled the whole rule out on the row and wrapped doing it; Krathe, 2026-09-10:
    -- "less verbose with tooltip and more clear." The rule moved to the tooltip; what stays on
    -- the row is which cooldown is meant.
    -- ⚠ KRATHE'S OWN WORDING, VERBATIM. My draft was "Show when I can't infuse" -- shorter, and
    -- it identified the cooldown only by implication. Naming Power Infusion says it outright,
    -- which matters in a box otherwise full of OTHER people's cooldowns: a label that does not
    -- say which spell reads as the tracked one. (That is also why "Show while on cooldown",
    -- shorter still, was never an option.)
    -- ★ ASKED THE OTHER WAY ROUND (2026-09-08), for the same reason the roles were: every
    -- other tick on this panel turns something ON when ticked, and this one turned a
    -- SUPPRESSION on -- so the whole box read as a list of things you enable except for the
    -- one that hid things. Krathe: "Hide the helper while on CD should be 'show even if PI is
    -- on CD' off by default."
    -- ⚠ THE STORE IS UNCHANGED AND THE DEFAULT ALREADY MATCHES. gateEnabled ships true, so
    -- `not gateEnabled` reads as UNTICKED -- which is the off-by-default he asked for -- and
    -- nobody's saved choice changes meaning. Inversion in the UI only, exactly like the roles.

    -- widget's label, and this label names its own setting -- unlike the sound tick, which
    -- passes a title because "Enable" heads nothing.
    -- ⚠ TWO LINES, ONE STATE EACH, and each one a plain sentence. What was here read
    -- "markers appear only while your Power Infusion is ready, so you are never pointed at
    -- someone you cannot infuse" -- a clause explaining a consequence of a rule it had not
    -- finished stating, in a vocabulary this panel does not use. Krathe, 2026-09-10:
    -- "markers? it should be effects and the wording itself is not very clear."
    -- ⚠ "EFFECTS" IS THE PANEL'S OWN WORD -- what the Effects tab lists and what ACTIVE
    -- INDICATORS holds. "Marker" belongs to the raid target icon and the dispel corner mark,
    -- which are other features entirely.
    -- ⚠ OFF FIRST. Off is the default, so the reader's first line is the behaviour they have.
    -- ⚠ "off cooldown" / "on cooldown" ECHOES THE LABEL rather than reaching for a synonym:
    -- the tick says on Cooldown, so the explanation says the same words back.

    -- a titled box around a single tick is more chrome than either setting is worth.

    -- ☠ THE CONTENTION NOTES ARE GONE, AND THE ARGUMENT THAT KEPT THEM WAS THE
    -- ARGUMENT AGAINST THEM. They survived an earlier cut because they were "the only
    -- facts nothing else on the panel ever states" -- but the clash warning states the
    -- same fact at the moment it applies, on the row it applies to, naming the effect in
    -- the way and the remedy. A general rule taught in advance to everyone, to spare the
    -- few who will meet the specific warning, is instruction text earning nothing.
    -- ⚠ The sizing lesson below them still holds and is worth keeping in view: notes
    -- of 38-53 characters reserved their space to within 2px, a 359-character one was out
    -- by 93. Short notes are exact; long ones drift, whatever constant is used. Any note
    -- added to this panel has to fit on one line.
    -- The one navigational fact text is genuinely needed for. Only while the
    -- icon group exists: position is not a question about icons that are not there.
end

-- ★★ ASKED POSITIVELY: "WATCH THESE ROLES", NOT "NEVER SHOW ON THESE" (2026-09-08).
-- ☠ THE STORE IS STILL AN EXCLUSION SET AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. helperExcludedRoles is what
-- the container gate reads, and it fails open on a missing entry -- a group with no assigned
-- roles reads "no role" for everyone and nothing is hidden, which is the safe direction.
-- Rewriting the store to a positive set would flip that: an empty table would mean "watch
-- nobody" and the whole feature would go dark on a group without role assignments.
-- ⇒ THE INVERSION IS IN THE UI ONLY. Ticked means watched, which is `not excluded`.
-- ⚠ AND THE OLD DEFAULTS ALREADY ARE THE NEW ONES: the store ships { TANK, HEALER }
-- excluded, which reads through this inversion as DPS on, Tanks and Healers off -- exactly
-- what Krathe asked for. No migration, and nobody's saved choice changes meaning.
-- ⚠ DAMAGER is a real UnitGroupRolesAssigned token (Core.lua's GetUnitRole passes it
-- through), so unticking DPS excludes it the same way the other two do. It was simply never

-- ── THE ROW PAGE'S SECTION LIST: REMOVED, 2026-09-08 ──
-- ☠ It described a layout that no longer exists. S.PIHelperSections existed so the popout
-- page could mount each section behind its own row, and that band went when the helper got
-- its own page -- leaving a table nothing read and a paragraph of reasoning about pane
-- widths and row counts that would have gone on looking maintained.
-- ⚠ The BODIES it wrapped are all still here (pihAddRoles / pihAddClasses / pihAddSound /
-- pihAddGateAndNotes) and S.BuildPIHelperBody composes them per tab. Only the row-page
-- adapter went. If a second layout ever needs them again, wrap them again -- do not read
-- this comment as a reason not to.

-- ★★ TWO TABS, THE SAME SHAPE THE DESIGNER'S RIGHT PANEL USES (2026-09-08).
-- ☠ THE SPLIT IS THE FEATURE'S OWN TWO QUESTIONS, and they are answered at different
-- times. TRIGGERS is "what counts as worth infusing" -- roles, the cooldown gate, which
-- classes and which spells -- and is set up once, carefully, probably while reading a spell
-- list. EFFECTS is "how do I want to be told" -- surface, colour, sound -- and gets fiddled
-- with. One column holding both meant scrolling past the long class list every time you
-- wanted to nudge a colour. Krathe: "we should also split on the right side Triggers and
-- Effects."
-- ⚠ THE KEYS ARE THE TAB IDS, and they are what the page's tab bar drives. Order matters:
-- triggers first, because you cannot sensibly choose how to be told about something you
-- have not yet said you care about.
    -- ★★★ FOUR SOURCES, FOUR ROWS, EACH WITH THE WAY IN TO ITS OWN LIST (2026-09-09).
    --
    -- ☠ WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY PROSE COULD NOT SAVE IT. The box had one button captioned
    -- for one of the four lists and a NOTE underneath explaining that the other three were not
    -- really lists you could edit -- an implementation detail (the ticks COPY a preset's spells
    -- rather than referencing it) leaking into the panel and being apologised for. Krathe:
    -- "the note below the link to edit the cooldown list is silly, the additional filters can
    -- also be edited, this really is an unclear mess."
    -- ⇒ He is right that they can be edited. The bug was that editing them did nothing, so the
    -- panel had to talk you out of trying.
    -- ★ AND THE REAL FIX CAME TWO ROUNDS LATER (2026-09-10). The first attempt kept the copy
    -- and made it honour each preset's ticks, re-taking it on every visit -- which made edits
    -- reach the helper, and left the list reading 91 spells with the same ids in two places:
    -- "so they are now twice on? this is very confusing." A copy that tracks its source is
    -- still a copy, and the pencil still promises something the tick does not do.
    -- ⇒ The ticks write `includes` now and nothing is copied at all (pihSyncTriggerExtras).
    -- Each row links to the list it names, and that list is the one being read.
    -- ⚠ NO NOTE. Four rows that each do the obvious thing need no paragraph underneath; a note
    -- explaining why a control does not behave as it looks is a bug report in prose.
    --
    -- ⚠ THE FIRST ROW HAS NO TICK, and that is not an oversight. The thirteen class ticks ARE
    -- that source's switch -- unticking them all is turning class cooldowns off -- and a tick
    -- here as well was removed for causing real harm: both read off the list, so toggling it
    -- wiped and restored all forty cooldowns and silently undid whichever classes the user had
    -- turned off. See P.PIH_CooldownCounts.
    -- ⚠ A LABEL WITH THE NUMBER IN IT, rather than a second right-aligned region. The row
    -- widget is a checkbox and the toolkit sizes it; a count anchored into it would be the one
    -- hand-placed element in a column that lays itself out. Numbers need no translating.
    -- ⚠ ONE NUMBER WHEN NOTHING IS TICKED OFF, TWO WHEN SOMETHING IS. "41/41" spends a
    -- fraction on the fact that nothing has been changed; "38/41" is the whole point of
    -- showing a fraction at all. Same rule the Classes and Cooldowns header follows, so the

-- THE CLASSIC DESIGNER'S INLINE ADD FLOWS (2026-09-22)
-- ------------------------------------------------------------
-- The split panel's three add areas -- the Effects tab's three scope cards and the
-- picker column they opened, and the Layout Groups / Debuffs tabs' choice-card
-- blocks -- are gone. Each tab now carries one PICTURE TILE per source, directly
-- on the page (S.BuildClassicAddTiles):
--   Effects        Add from a Spell / Add from a Filter   runs S.BuildAddIndicatorPane
--                                                         INSIDE the tab, in place of
--                                                         the list (the flow below)
--   Layout Groups  Spell Group / Filter Group             S.BuildAddLayoutGroupPane,
--   Debuffs pool   Debuff Group                           S.BuildAddDebuffGroupPane,
--                                                         mounted on the page (opts.
--                                                         onPage): ONE CLICK ADDS
-- One builder per surface, two hosts; nothing below re-implements a pane. The
-- source the tile named is handed to the indicator pane (opts.source), so it never
-- asks it again.
--
-- ☠ THE GROUP TILES ADD ON ONE CLICK (2026-09-22, second pass). The first pass ran
-- the group panes as a flow too, with the chosen kind's picture and an Add button
-- to press -- a confirm step for a question the tile had already answered. A group
-- is created with defaults and edited in place, so there is nothing to confirm.
--
-- ☠ NOT A POPOUT. The first version of this (ffd4031c) docked the panes in a
-- keyed popout beside the window; the author asked for the flow in the tab. The
-- popout, its dock, its pin and its close rules are gone with it.
--
-- ⚠ THE FLOW IS STATE, AND THE TAB REBUILD DRAWS IT. S.classicAddFlow says which
-- flow is running; S.SwitchTab -- the island's one refresh path -- asks
-- S.SyncClassicAddFlow first, and the tab builders ask S.BuildClassicAddFlow
-- before drawing their list. Entering, leaving and finishing are all a tab rebuild,
-- never a page rebuild (ONE RETAINED BUILD PER MODE, GUI/Panel.lua).
--
-- ⚠ WHAT ENDS IT. The flow was started against one mode, pool and spec (the spec
-- on My Buffs only), with the designer on. Any rebuild for another tab, or against
-- a context that no longer matches, or with the designer off, ends it -- the pane's
-- Add button would otherwise write into a pool the user has left. The page going
-- away ends it too, and the next showing draws the list.

-- cooldown swipe, border (full CreateBorderControls set incl. the DF-owned
-- animations), duration text (show / font / scale / outline / anchor /
-- offsets / colour-by-time / colour / hide-above) and stack count (show +
-- text styling). Controls bind to group.style via a defaults proxy
-- (CreateInstanceProxy's idiom): nil keys read the pre-style defaults, so
-- an untouched section changes nothing — the factory renders a style-less
-- (or all-default) group byte-identically to before. Omitted vs the placed
-- effect card, by capability: Min Stacks (no formatter on the native stack
-- path — secret trap), Hide Icon / size / scale / alpha / frame level
-- (group-level layout already owns size; the rest are per-indicator
-- concepts), Expiring / Show When Missing (remaining-time / presence reads).
-- Structural fields (show toggles, colour-by-time, hide-above, border
-- on/off) move the group struct sig -> the factory Rebuilds; everything
-- else hot-applies via the cosmetic sig. Collapse state persists PER CARD
-- under "adGroupStyle:<cardKey>" — cardKey is the caller's expand-key form
