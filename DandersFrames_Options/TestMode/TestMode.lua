        -- ☠ isAFK LIVES HERE, NOT ON THE OUT-OF-RANGE UNIT. The AFK icon carries a
        -- TICKING TIMER, and it used to sit on Мишок below — the only outOfRange unit —
        -- so the one element that exists to be READ was on the one frame that is
        -- deliberately dimmed, and it was lost (Krathe, 2026-08-08).
        -- ⇒ RULE: a TIMED or ANIMATED element must not share a frame with the range fade
        -- or the dead state. This unit's other states are all static badges (leader
        -- crown, skull marker, combat flag), so nothing competes with a countdown.
        -- ★ ONE JOB PER FRAME (Krathe, 2026-08-08). Each of the five demonstrates a
        -- distinct set and nothing doubles up: this one is the AFK TIMER plus the leader
        -- badges. Both icon strips are off — the defensive row would show here by default
        -- (TANK role) and the missing-buff strip shows everywhere by default, and between
        -- them they crowded the timer this frame exists for. They live on Healsworth and
        -- Xx respectively.
        -- ⚠ This unit KEEPS its debuff row — `showDebuffs = false` was tried here and was
        -- the wrong tool. The ask was to drop the IMPORTANT (enlarged + badged) debuff
        -- sitting over the AFK timer, not every debuff. `showImportantDebuff = false` is
        -- the right one, and it now exists: the row renders plain, so the countdown this

        -- gated on isLeader, which is this unit — and readyCheckIcon and afkIcon share
        -- anchor CENTER, offset 0,0 AND frame level 30, i.e. the same point. With the AFK
        -- timer here they overlapped. The ready check moved to Мишок: it is a static icon
        -- and survives being faded, where a countdown does not.
        -- ⚠ THE LIVE COLLISION IS UNFIXED — a real unit that is AFK during a real ready
        -- check still gets both at the same point, draw order by creation order. That is

    -- Test aura data - expanded for testing layouts. spellID (where a stable,
    -- still-live spell matches) lets the 12.1 container preview show the REAL
    -- spell tooltip on hover; entries without one fall back to a name tooltip.
    -- ☠ THE `name` IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH, NOT THE ID. _paintTestSlot only keeps
    -- spellID when `C_Spell.GetSpellName(id) == name`, and resolves by name when it
    -- doesn't — so a stale ID self-heals. The one thing that gate CANNOT catch is a
    -- different spell sharing the name: `Deadly Poison` shipped as 2823, the rogue's
    -- one-hour WEAPON IMBUE, and previewed with the imbue's tooltip on a party frame
    -- for exactly that reason (2818 is the DoT). If two spells share a name, name the
    -- one you mean with its ID and check the tooltip in game.
    --
    -- ⚠ ORDER IS MEANINGFUL. Entries are handed out in pool order from a per-frame
    -- rotation (testPoolOffset), so ADJACENT entries appear together on one frame.
    -- Buffs alternate duration classes; the debuff pool front-loads the four dispellable
    -- colours (Bleed → Disease → Curse → Poison) then runs none/none/Magic/Curse/none/none,
    -- so no two neighbours share a type and the untyped slots pair off into the density
    -- dial described on the pool below. Reordering silently degrades both.
    -- ☠ ONE SPELL PER CLASS IN ANY WINDOW, AND THAT IS AN ARITHMETIC CONSTRAINT.
    --
    -- _paintTestSlot adopts the player's SPEC OVERRIDE wholesale so icon, name and
    -- tooltip move together (deliberate, and correct). The consequence is that two
    -- entries can COLLAPSE onto one spell for one class — a priest saw Prayer of Mending
    -- twice, because Power Word: Shield and PoM swap between Disc and Holy.
    --
    -- ⚠ SEPARATING THEM IS NOT ENOUGH, which is how the first fix failed. Each frame
    -- draws a WRAPPING run of `count` consecutive entries, so over a 10-entry pool with
    -- a 5-icon preview the only pairs that never share a window are those EXACTLY 5
    -- apart. PW:S was moved to 9 against PoM at 2 — distance 3 — and offset 7 hands a
    -- frame entries 8,9,10,1,2, containing both. (Krathe again: "we do random from the
    -- 1-10? so it can still pull PW:S and PoM on one set of 5 buffs".)
    --
    -- Which caps it at TWO spells per class, at i and i+5. Four priest spells cannot be
    -- made safe at any ordering, so the pool now runs one class per slot in the first
    -- five and repeats that order in the second five:
    --     1-5  PALADIN PRIEST DRUID SHAMAN MONK
    --     6-10 PALADIN PRIEST DRUID SHAMAN WARRIOR
    -- Every window of 5 therefore holds five DIFFERENT classes, so no override can merge
    -- two of them. Verified for every offset the rotation produces.
    -- ⚠ Adding an entry breaks the arithmetic. Keep the pool at 10 and swap, or redo the
    -- spacing for the new size.

-- ============================================================
-- ★ THE RAID PREVIEW ALLOCATION  (Krathe, 2026-08-08)
-- ============================================================
-- Which raid frame demonstrates WHAT. This replaces the index arithmetic the raid
-- branch used to carry (`i % 4 == 3` for range, `i == 3` for AFK, and so on), which
-- was unauditable: two rules written months apart silently landed on the same frame
-- and nobody could see it without evaluating the modulos by hand.
--
-- ☠ THAT IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL — IT SHIPPED TWICE. `outOfRange = (i % 4 == 3)` selects
-- {3,7,11,15,19,…}. `isAFK = (i == 3)` was IN that set, so the AFK countdown sat on a
-- deliberately faded frame — the same bug the party table carries a ☠ note about,
-- reintroduced here because the raid side expressed the idea as arithmetic, not a list.
-- (Its DND twin had the identical fault; DND was later dropped from the addon.)
--
-- ★ THE RULES THESE SETS ENCODE (same as the party table, now checkable at a glance):
--   1. A TIMED or ANIMATED element never shares a frame with the range fade or death.
--   2. At most ONE centre-region element per frame — afkIcon, readyCheckIcon,
--      summon/resurrect all draw at CENTER 0,0, so two on one frame
--      is a guaranteed overlap, not a near miss.
--   3. The missing-buff strip and the defensive row never share a frame: they occupy
--      the same band, and together they were the "busiest frame" problem in party.
--   4. A dead frame carries the resurrect marker and nothing else.
--   5. An out-of-range frame carries STATIC badges only.
--
-- ⚠ COVERAGE IS FRONT-LOADED, because raidTestFrameCount is user-driven (1-40).
-- Frames 1-10 cover every primary indicator; the three secondary status icons (summon,
-- phased, vehicle) start at 11. Everything appears by 20. Below 10 frames the
-- preview is necessarily partial — that is a property of the slider, not a gap here.
--
-- ⚠ 21-40 MIRROR 1-20 (+20) via inRaidSet, so a full 40-frame raid repeats the spread
-- instead of trailing off into 20 identical frames. Add an index ≤ 20 and the upper
-- half inherits it automatically.

    -- So the whole block computed values nothing could observe -- including a `.dispel`
    -- and an `.auras` entry that never had a reader at all, in any build.
    --
    -- ⚠ THIS IS THE SAME LESSON THE SURVIVING NOTES IN THIS FILE ALREADY TEACH, one
    -- level up. Each of those notes records pruning ONE element's hand-mirrored alpha
    -- after it shipped a bug (the squared range fade, the squared health fade, the six
    -- wrong OOR fallbacks, the icons). Every prune was correct and none of them asked

    -- ☠ THE HEALTH-BAR AND BACKGROUND COLOUR BLOCKS USED TO LIVE HERE (~135 lines).
    -- DF:UpdateHealthBarAppearance and DF:UpdateBackgroundAppearance own both now and
    -- accept test frames, so the shared appearance pass at the end of this function
    -- applies them. The copy was not merely redundant, it was WRONG in two ways:
    --   * it MULTIPLIED the OOR alpha into the base (classColorAlpha * healthBarAlpha)
    --     where live REPLACES it -- so at Health Bar Alpha 0.5 with the stock OOR 0.2
    --     the preview rendered 0.10 against live's 0.20, and the background, which
    --     multiplies twice, rendered 0.03 against live's 0.10;
    --   * its PERCENT-mode gradient took the raw class token from testData while live
    --     resolves through the same stops with the frame's own colour weights.
    -- (Audit, 2026-08-07.)

    -- ☠ THE FRAME-LEVEL ALPHA BLOCK USED TO LIVE HERE — a preview reimplementation of
    -- DF:UpdateFrameAppearance's four branches (OOR / above-threshold / normal / the
    -- element-specific mode). DELETED: the shared appearance pass below owns frame alpha
    -- outright, and it runs LAST, so this could only ever be overwritten or disagree.
    --
    -- ⚠ IT ALREADY DISAGREED. Its threshold test was `healthPct >= threshold - 0.5` on a
    -- 0-100 percent; live's is `dfHealthPct > threshold/100` on a fraction. At EXACTLY the
    -- threshold this faded and live did not. Invisible only because live wrote second.
    --
    -- ★ And keeping it is what hid the bug it was meant to solve. When the appearance
    -- functions were shared (d3c6d046, 2026-08-07) the live path became authoritative and
    -- started overwriting this — but its health-fade branch was gated on a flag whose
    -- driver still bailed out in test mode, so the preview got NEITHER and every frame
    -- rendered opaque. A second pathway does not fail loudly; it fails by looking handled.
    -- ⇒ Preview differs from live in DATA (dfHealthPct, dfIsDead, the dfTestShow* stamps),
    -- never in RENDERING. If a live appearance function cannot run on a preview frame,
    -- teach it the data fork — do not copy it here.

    -- ★ FADES NOW COME FROM THE LIVE FUNCTIONS. These three used to be hand-mirrored

    -- row and the AD indicators all silently stopped fading out of range, one at a
    -- time, because each had an oor*Alpha key in ElementAppearance with no counterpart
    -- in this file). ElementAppearance's own functions now accept test frames: every
    -- unit read they make goes through GetInRange / IsDeadOrOffline, both of which
    -- prefer the stamps set at the top of this function. One policy, one place.
    --
    -- ⚠ AFTER the two drives above, not before: both widgets are created LAZILY by
    -- those drives, so earlier in the pass they are still nil on a frame's first
    -- paint. Neither drive touches alpha, so setting it here sticks.
    -- Update Aura Designer test indicators through the factory containers — the
    -- SAME path as the bulk DF:UpdateAllTestAuraDesigner, so the per-frame and
    -- bulk previews can't drift (the legacy Engine:UpdateTestFrame is gone).
    --
    -- ☠ THIS MUST RUN *BEFORE* THE APPEARANCE PASS, NOT AFTER. SyncFrame re-styles
    -- each indicator, which resets its alpha host to the indicator's BASE alpha --
    -- so with it below, every out-of-range AD fade the appearance pass had just
    -- applied was wiped a few lines later. It is signature-gated, which is what made
    -- the bug look intermittent and sent three fixes to the wrong place: toggling a
    -- setting that changes nothing structural makes SyncFrame a no-op, the fade
    -- survives, and the preview looks correct -- while a fresh Test Mode open or a
    -- Quick Preset swap DOES change the signature, re-styles, and drops the AD
    -- indicator back to full opacity on an out-of-range frame. Measured with
    -- /df debug zorder: buff 0.20, debuff 0.20, missing-buff 0.50, AD 1.00, and one
    -- re-run of UpdateAuraDesignerAppearance took it straight to 0.20.

    -- the four bars, missing buff, defensive and the Aura Designer -- 16 of its 19
    -- functions accept test frames now. The three that still bail (health bar,
    -- background, frame-level health fade) need a health stamp that does not exist
    -- yet, and keep their own blocks above.
    --
    -- ☠ THIS IS THE FIX FOR A WHOLE CLASS OF BUG. The pattern was: an oor*Alpha or
    -- fadeDead* key gets added to ElementAppearance and silently not to the copy that
    -- used to live here, and the preview quietly stops matching live. That happened to
    -- the missing-buff strip, the defensive row and the AD indicators in three separate
    -- reports over two days. ADD NOTHING HERE THAT ElementAppearance ALREADY APPLIES,
    -- and ADD NOTHING BELOW IT that touches alpha. (Audit, 2026-08-07.)
    -- ⚠ BEFORE the appearance pass, not after. UpdateHealthFade's job here is to set
    -- frame.dfHealthFadeActive, and UpdateFrameAppearance (inside the pass below) gates
    -- its health-fade branch on that flag — so a call afterwards would set the flag one
    -- pass too late and the frame would render opaque until something else refreshed it.

    -- lines later, so the surviving block recomputed the identical result over the top

    -- inside a branch its own caller had already gated on that key.
    --
    -- ⚠ There is now ONE ready-check implementation, in DF:UpdateTestStatusIcons. Do not
    -- reinstate a copy here: a second pathway does not fail loudly, it fails by looking
    -- handled (the same reasoning as the ★ note at the top of UpdateTestFrame).

    -- ef3c56e0.

    -- ☠ AND IT WAS OVERWRITING, NOT COMPOUNDING. This pass ended with a bare
    -- SetAlpha(alpha), so it discarded whatever the applier had computed -- including
    -- the per-icon `<prefix>Alpha` setting, which the four hand-rolled blocks never
    -- read in the first place. Set roleIconAlpha to 0.5 and live dimmed the icon while
    -- the preview drew it solid.
    --
    -- The health-fade arm went further and previewed something live does not do at
    -- all: HealthFade.lua touches no status icon, so `dfTestHealthFadeAlphas.icons`
    -- described a behaviour that exists only in test mode. Dead and out-of-range fade
    -- are both real and both live in GetStatusIconFadeAlpha, which reads the same
    -- dfTestIsDead stamp the preview already sets.
end

-- ★ ShowTestIconAsText and ApplyTestIconTimerFont are GONE. The first restated
-- live's ShowIconAsText and then re-applied the font and text colour on top --
-- work DF:ApplyStatusIconSettings already does, and doing it a second time AFTERWARDS
-- clobbered any per-state tint. The second was already a one-line forward to
-- DF:ApplyTimerTextSettings, which ApplyStatusIconSettings also calls. The preview now
-- uses DF:ShowStatusIconAsText, which IS live's function. (Audit, 2026-08-07.)

-- ☠ (Removed) FormatTestAFKTime and testAFKStartTimes, the last two pieces of the
-- preview's private AFK implementation.
--
-- Worth recording how this ended, because the first pass stopped a level too early:
-- the formatter was a verbatim copy of a StatusIcons.lua file-local, so it was fixed
-- by publishing DF:FormatAFKTime and forwarding to it. That was correct but small --
-- the ~50 lines AROUND the formatter were still a copy, and one of them had already
-- dropped live's afkIconHideInCombat gate. Sharing the leaf made the duplication
-- look handled while the drift stayed. The whole block now calls DF:UpdateAFKIcon
-- with an isAFK override, and the start times live in live's own table.

-- frame size, health-bar texture/orientation, missing-health orientation, border and

-- which it invoked at the end via the ApplyFrameStyle alias (Update.lua: that alias
-- is a one-line forward). So the copy ran first and the real thing overwrote it.
--
-- Two things the copy got WRONG while it was there:
--   * raw SetSize instead of DF:SetPixelPerfectSize, and it read db.frameWidth where
--     live reads frame.dfPinnedWidth or db.frameWidth -- so it would have sized a
--     pinned frame by the global width. Inert only because it was never called on one.
--   * a missing-health TEXTURE write, which looked unique but is not: both test
--     update paths already set it, because both call DF.SetMissingHealthBarValue --
--     the LIVE setter, which applies the texture itself. (This file has no
--     SafeSetStatusBarTexture call of its own, and never had one.)
--
-- Kept as a named function rather than deleted because call sites pair it with
-- UpdateTestFrame and the pairing reads clearly. (Audit, 2026-08-07.)

-- ☠ (Removed) DF.lastLayoutRefresh, and the "throttled layout refresh for slider

-- gone, so the name was documenting a mechanism that no longer exists.

-- Engine-side test-mode teardown: the state that is NOT owned by the test frames
-- themselves -- the global aura data provider, and the pinned-frame preview.
--
-- HideTestFrames / HideRaidTestFrames do this inline, but two OTHER paths tear test
-- mode down by clearing DF.testMode / DF.raidTestMode directly: combat entry
-- (Core.lua, PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED) and zone change (Frames/Headers.lua,
-- PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD). Both used to skip it, which left C_UnitAuras on the
-- SAMPLE provider for the rest of the session -- the restore lives only in
-- AuraContainer.SetTestMode's `else` branch. The [combat] state driver shows the
-- LIVE frames the instant combat starts, so they then rendered fake auras, with the
-- identity gate off, aura row caps stuck at the test slider value and missing-buff
-- badges on corpses. The watchdog could not recover it either: ensureProviderWatch
-- returns early while _ownsProviderSwitch is set, and only this path clears it.
--
-- Call AFTER the mode flags are cleared: the provider is shared between party and
-- raid, so it goes back to real data only when NEITHER mode is left running.
-- DF._testModeHandover covers the gap in a party<->raid SWAP. The GUI clears the
-- outgoing mode's flag before it sets the incoming one, so for that instant neither
-- is true and this would tear the engines down and immediately rebuild them — every
-- aura container reconfigured to parse LIVE data that nothing ever renders, plus a
-- full provider reset/switch round-trip. That intermediate state is invisible and
-- pure cost; the swap sets the flag across the hand-over so we simply stay in test
-- mode. The GUI clears it and calls this again, so a Show* that bails (raid frames
-- disabled, combat) still settles correctly.

-- ☠ FRAME-SIDE TEST-MODE TEARDOWN — the twin of TeardownTestModeEngines above, and it
-- exists for the same reason: THREE paths end test mode, and only one of them was doing

--
--   HideTestFrames / HideRaidTestFrames  — the ordinary exit, did all of it
--   combat entry   (Core.lua, PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED)   — absorbs + personal targeted only
--   zone change    (Headers.lua, PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD) — frame:Hide() and nothing else
--
-- ⚠ frame:Hide() IS NOT ENOUGH, which is what made this survivable for so long. The
-- Aura Designer's borders are parented to UIParent, not to the unit frame, so hiding the
-- frame leaves them on screen: zone into a raid with the preview up and the AD indicators
-- stayed floating over live frames until something else happened to clear them. The
-- absorb textures are the same shape (HideTestFrames hides all three by hand), and the
-- pet / personal-targeted / Targeted List previews are separate frame sets that no
-- amount of hiding the party frames reaches.
--
-- Safe in combat, which is why the combat path can call it: ClearFrame only tears down
-- textures and tables, and the test pet frames are deliberately plain Buttons and NOT
-- SecureUnitButtonTemplate (see DF:CreateTestPetFrame) precisely so they can be hidden
-- under lockdown.
--
-- Call it from any new teardown path too — do not hand-copy a subset of it.

-- ON, and applying it forces every other key in TEST_TOGGLE_KEYS OFF. So a new
-- test toggle is OFF in every preset until it's explicitly listed here — and
-- automatically ON in Full, which is built from the key list.
--
-- The old hand-written branches only covered 11 of the 19 panel toggles, so the
-- other 8 (pets, heal prediction, reduced max, Text Designer, Aura Designer,
-- animate targeted list, selection, aggro) kept whatever value they happened to
-- have. "Full" wasn't full, and "Static" wasn't a reproducible baseline.
--
-- Sliders are deliberately NOT touched: they're a working preference, not part of a
-- preset's visual identity.
--
-- ☠ ONE EXCEPTION — `testDefensiveCount`. It is a count, but it is also the defensive
-- row's ONLY on/off since the "Defensive Icon" checkbox was removed, so a preset that
-- used to turn that row on or off has to keep doing it (Krathe, 2026-08-08). It is
-- declared in TEST_TOGGLE_KEYS like any toggle and listed `= true` in the presets that
-- want it; the apply/match helpers translate that to 1 / 0. The frame, buff and debuff
-- counts stay untouched — they only change HOW MUCH of a row shows, never whether it does.

-- ☠ REBUILD WITHOUT REPAINT. Each of these bulk refreshers tears down and rebuilds
-- its surface -- the aura-container rows, the AD indicators, the defensive icon, the
-- missing-buff strip -- and the fresh widgets come back at ALPHA 1.0 carrying none of
-- the fade the appearance pass had applied. They run AFTER UpdateTestFrame's appearance
-- pass (ApplyTestPreset: UpdateAllFrames, then RefreshAllTestSurfaces), so flipping a
-- preset left every rebuilt surface at full opacity while the rest of the frame stayed
-- faded -- which is why a faded defensive icon had a full-brightness AD indicator
-- showing through it, and why toggling Out of Range off and on "fixed" it (that path
-- re-runs the appearance pass with nothing rebuilding behind it).
--
-- ★ Whoever rebuilds a surface repaints it, per frame, for that surface only. Putting
-- it here rather than at the call sites means the individual panel toggles (Aura
-- Designer, Defensive Icon, Missing Buff, Dispel Overlay), which rebuild without going
-- through RefreshAllTestSurfaces at all, are covered by the same fix.

    -- removed: "a checkbox plus a slider whose 0 means the same thing is two controls
    -- for one decision, and they can disagree -- checkbox off with the slider at 3 reads
    -- as broken." That objection is about two SOURCES OF TRUTH, not about two controls,
    -- so this box is a VIEW of testDefensiveCount rather than a key of its own:
    --   checked  == (count > 0)
    --   unticking -> remember the count, write 0
    --   ticking   -> restore the remembered count (1 if there is nothing to restore)
    -- They cannot disagree because there is only one value; move the slider to 0 and the
    -- box unticks itself on the next refresh, tick the box and the slider follows.
    -- Everything downstream is untouched: the preset system still sees one count key
    -- (TEST_COUNT_KEYS translates `= true` to 1/0), and no new key reaches the profile,
    -- the export categories or the sync map.
