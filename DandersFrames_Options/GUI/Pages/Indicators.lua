        --                          order.
        --               ...then    Duration Bar and Pandemic, the two 12.1-factory

        -- under their hand. What the rebuild was buying is the hideOn/disableOn
        -- passes, and that is precisely what the pane's own refresh does.
        -- ★ Classic no longer rebuilds either: the two Hide Above controls carry
        -- their gate as disableOn, so a state pass is what the rebuild bought --
