        -- ===== THE PAGE'S TWO LAYOUTS =====================================
        -- This is the biggest page in the addon and the LAST of the sweep: one
        -- shared typography block plus THIRTEEN status icons, each carrying the
        -- same Settings / Appearance / Position trio (AFK adds a fourth box for
        -- its timer). Forty-one groups, ~215 widgets, and every icon says the
        -- same three things with a different prefix.
        --
        -- ☠ SO THE SHAPE IS WRITTEN ONCE AND PARAMETERISED, NOT THIRTEEN TIMES.
        -- BuildIconSettingsGroup / BuildIconAppearanceGroup /
        -- BuildIconPositionGroup take a SPEC -- key prefix, enable key and label,
        -- which callbacks the icon's own render path wants, and the handful of
        -- extras that are genuinely per-icon -- and MountIcon drives both layouts
        -- from it. Thirteen copies of a builder would drift, and the first thing
        -- to drift would be one of the callbacks: eleven icons repaint through
        -- DF:LightweightUpdateIcon*(tag) and two through
        -- DF:UpdateAllFramesStatusIcons, which is exactly the kind of difference
        -- a copy-paste pass flattens by accident.
        --
        -- CLASSIC is exactly what it always was: fourteen collapsible sections in
        -- column 1, each icon's section holding its Settings / Appearance /
        -- Position boxes (and AFK's Timer Text), each with its live header
        -- preview.
        --
        -- MODERN is the Debuff Bar's collapsible-card design, with ONE CARD PER
        -- ICON: the icon's Settings, Appearance and Position builders mounted one
        -- after another into the same card, two per row when the card is wide
        -- enough, captions dim. The icon's Enable is the card's HEADER TICK (the
        -- Settings builder skips its in-body copy through hoistToggle), so an
        -- icon is switched on or off without opening anything, and a shut card
        -- says "Off" or its summary. Role has no single enable, so its card has
        -- no tick. Icon Text Settings is a card of its own, and AFK's Timer Text
        -- is too, right under the AFK card: it has its own Font, Offset X and
        -- Offset Y, which inside the AFK card would sit beside the icon's own
        -- Offset X and Offset Y under the same names, and it hides as a unit.
        --
        -- ☠ NO HEADER PREVIEWS IN MODERN. The cards carry the tick and the
        -- summary; the preview swatches stay classic-only.
        --
        --   column 1   Icon Text Settings, then Role, Leader, Target Marker,
        --              Ready Check, Ping, Summon
        --   column 2   BG Carrier, Combat, Resurrection, Phased, AFK (+ Timer

        -- kept, left column top to bottom and then the right -- which is also

        -- height, two per row).

        -- CLASSIC is exactly what it always was: five 280 boxes in two columns,
        -- in the columns and the order they have always had.
        --
        -- MODERN is the Debuff Bar's collapsible-card design: one card per box,
        -- controls TWO PER ROW inside a card wide enough, captions drawn dim, the
        -- value summary in a shut card's corner, Expand All / Collapse All at the
        -- top. Four cards:
        --
        --   column 1   Settings -- whether the overlay exists at all (the PAGE
        --              gate, which stays in its body), which dispels light it
        --              up, where its colours come from, and Pulse Overlay.
        --              Gradient -- the overlay's own wash.
        --   column 2   Dispel Symbol, Border -- the two things drawn ON it.
        --
        -- ⚠ GRADIENT SITS IN COLUMN 1, where classic always had it. As cards the
        -- page was one behaviour card against three looks cards -- a short left
        -- column beside a tall right one -- and the Gradient is the tallest card
        -- on the page. Classic's own reasoning puts it there too: it is the
        -- OVERLAY's wash, so it goes with the overlay's settings rather than
        -- with the symbol and ring drawn over it.
        --
        -- ⚠ PULSE OVERLAY MOVED INTO SETTINGS. Its classic box ("Display") holds
        -- that one checkbox, and as a lone control row it was the one element on
        -- the page with its own width and height. It pulses the whole overlay --
        -- the wash, the ring and the symbol together -- so it goes in the card
        -- that is about the whole overlay.
        --
        -- Show Dispel Symbol, Show Border and Show Gradient are the three cards'
        -- header ticks (their builders skip their in-body copy through
