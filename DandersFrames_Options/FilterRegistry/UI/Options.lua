-- therefore compiled as nil globals and every route through single-filter import died on
-- "attempt to index a nil value (global 'R')": a clean import, and "Import as Copy".
--
-- The regression came from hoisting the body OUT of BuildFilterDesignerPage to chain the
-- rename prompt; the references came with it and the scope did not. This file already
-- warns about the identical hazard for `GUI` a hundred lines above -- same trap, second
-- name.
--
-- Fixed by resolving R at call time (DF.FilterRegistry is the main addon's, resident
-- before this companion file ever runs) and by promoting SelectFilter to a file-scope

    -- WHICH LAYOUT THIS IS
    -- ------------------------------------------------------------
    -- `Add` is the tell, and it is the same tell the Aura Designer uses
    -- (Editor.lua's DF.BuildAuraDesignerPage): a caller holding BuildPage's own Add
    -- can be served BANDS; one that does not -- an older call site, or classic --
    -- can only have the island.
    --
    -- ☠ THIS PAGE IS NOT A DESIGNER SHELL, WHICH IS WHY IT DOES NOT BUILD ONE.
    -- GUI:BuildDesignerShell is a preview-plus-tabs shape -- a canvas, a strip
    -- saying what the canvas is showing, a view switcher, then the caller's bands.
    -- The Filter Designer has none of those three: it is a MASTER/DETAIL, a list of
    -- filters and the spells inside the one you picked. Handed the shell it would
    -- use one of its six slots. So what this borrows from the rework is the COLUMN,
    -- not the shell: the master collapses into a popout row -- the all-rows rule,
    -- which is exactly "more than one option goes in a panel" -- and the detail
    -- becomes the page.
    --
    -- ☠ NOTHING BELOW THIS POINT IS BRANCHED ON IT. The island builds exactly as it
    -- always did, anchored off `parent`, and the band arm RE-HOMES its five roots
    -- at the end (AdoptBands, at the foot of this function). Threading a layout
    -- test through 2,700 lines of one closure would fork every site it touched;
    -- re-anchoring five frames forks none of them, and the two layouts cannot
    -- drift apart because there is only one build.
    local tools = (Add and GUI.CreatePopoutPageTools and DF:DesignersUseRows() and not DF:IsClassicSettingsLayout())

    local rowsMode = (Add ~= nil) and (tools ~= nil)
    -- (FILTERROW_H is gone. It named DandersUI's plate-plus-gap so the page-height
    -- arithmetic could reserve two popout rows above the detail; the band arm has
    -- neither a fixed number of rows nor a detail band to reserve for, and its one
    -- band of rows reports its own height through the group it lives in. A constant
    -- nothing spends is a number waiting to disagree with the kit.)
    -- The gap the island puts between its stacked pieces, kept so the band arm has
    -- the same rhythm rather than a second set of numbers.
    --
    -- ☠ AND IT IS NOW THE DESIGNER SHELL'S NUMBER, NOT A SECOND COPY OF IT. The
    -- shell gained the same rhythm for the Aura and Text Designers (the bands used
    -- to stack flush and read as "crampted together"), and it took THIS value
    -- because this page had already chosen it. Read rather than re-typed, so the
    -- three designer pages cannot drift into three near-identical gaps. Read here,
    -- inside the builder, rather than at file scope: this file loads before nothing
    -- in particular, and a page builds long after every file has.

    -- ========== LAYOUT CONSTANTS ==========
    -- Panel height tracks the window instead of being pinned at 490. The page has
    -- two independently scrolling lists, so any height the window can give them is
    -- height they can use — a fixed value left a dead band under both panels on
    -- anything but a short window.
    --
    -- Measured from GUI.contentFrame, which is anchored to the window's edges and
    -- is therefore the real viewport. CHROME is everything this page stacks above
    -- and below the panels: top pad + banner + gap, and below, the spell-database
    -- freshness label and the bottom pad. It matches the spacer's own arithmetic
    -- further down; both read this constant so they cannot drift apart.
    --
    -- CHIP_ROW_H is the consumer chip row between the banner and the panels, plus
    -- the gap above it. It is folded into CHROME rather than added at each site so
    -- the panel sizer and the page-height spacer cannot disagree about whether the
    -- row exists -- they read one number.
    local CHIP_H = 22
    local CHIP_ROW_H = CHIP_H + 10

    -- ☠ TOP_INSET IS NOW 0, and it must stay in the arithmetic rather than being
    -- deleted. It reserved vertical room for the Copy/Sync/Reset row the page host
    -- Add()s above this content -- 25 for the buttons plus the standard gap. This
    -- page owns no per-mode keys since filter selection moved to the consumers, so
    -- CreateCopyButton returns a zero-height placeholder and there is no row to
    -- clear: the reservation was pure empty space at the top of the page.
    --
    -- ⚠ It is declared HERE, beside PANEL_CHROME_H, and CHROME is written in terms
    -- of it. Those two numbers have to move together -- the inset positions the
    -- banner, CHROME tells the panel sizer and the page-height spacer how much room
    -- the banner and everything around it take -- and this file has already been
    -- bitten twice by exactly that class of paired constant drifting apart (see the
    -- ROW2_Y / HEADER_H note in the right-hand header). Written as a sum, a change
    -- to the inset cannot silently leave the sizer behind.
    --
    -- ☠ ABOVE THE PANELS ONLY -- BELOW_PANELS_H is the other end. This was ONE
    -- number (66) covering both, and splitting it is fine; what was NOT fine was
    -- the first attempt at the bottom half, which measured dbFreshLabel:GetHeight()
    -- and called that "measured, not guessed". It was neither: GUI:CreateLabel
    -- opens at a placeholder SetSize(w, 40) and only converges to the real wrapped
    -- height in a deferred pass that is gated on `frame.settingsGroup` -- and this
    -- label is anchored straight to leftPanel, so it is in no group, the converge
    -- never runs, and GetHeight() returns the placeholder 40 for the life of the
    -- page. A hard-coded 40 wearing a measurement's clothes.
    --
    -- 44 is HEAD's own allowance, arrived at before this session and correct: the
    -- 2px gap under the panel, the note, and a little air. Restored rather than
    -- re-derived.
    --

    -- their rest border is C_BORDER at HALF alpha, which over a hovered row
    -- composites to ~0.235: a 0.015 difference, so a button dissolves into the
    -- highlight it is sitting on. At rest the row is ~0.10 and the same button
    -- is 0.084 clear, which is why they only merge on hover.
    --
    -- Only row.remove needs it now: the row's click does not fire that button, so it
    -- just gets its border brightened enough to stay legible. Priming a destructive
    -- "x" the row will NOT trigger would be worse than the merge.
    --
    -- row.check is deliberately not wired in: its checked mark is accent-coloured, so
    -- it separates from the wash by HUE rather than by a few percent of grey, and it
    -- takes no mouse of its own.
    --
    -- This does not move the row's own colour, which the main nav shares. The
    -- button's own OnEnter/OnLeave still owns its look while the mouse is on it;
    -- leaving a child re-enters the row, so the row's OnEnter re-applies after.
    --
    -- Left-hand filter rows carry no chromed controls (a label, a count and the
    -- override dot), so they are deliberately not wired to this.
    -- Derived, not picked by eye: at rest the border reads ~0.235 on a ~0.096 row,
    -- a separation of ~0.14. Holding that same separation above a 0.22 hovered row
    -- wants ~0.36 at full alpha. 0.40 gives a little margin without making the

    -- That is why they are Title Case mid-sentence; do not "fix" the capitals.
    --
    -- ⚠ Colour, not caps, and not bold. The draft this replaced shouted BUFF to say
    -- buffs-only; Krathe's call 2026-08-10 was to emphasise instead. Bold is not
    -- available -- a FontString has no weight axis, "bold" in WoW means either a
    -- different font FILE (we ship Roboto-Bold, but SetSettingsFont resolves the
    -- USER's chosen settings font, so hard-coding one face makes the emphasised words
    -- the only text on the page ignoring that setting) or the OUTLINE flag, which at
    -- 11px reads as smeared rather than heavy. Colour has neither problem and is what
    -- WoW itself uses for inline emphasis.
    --
    -- ⚠ Deliberately NOT GUI:ToneHex("success"/"danger"), which is the sanctioned
    -- helper for inline emphasis and is WRONG here: those hexes carry the banner tone
    -- vocabulary, so a red drawn from it would say this debuff sentence is a warning.
    -- It is not -- it is a neutral statement of who authors those filters. These two
    -- are category colours (which kind of aura), muted to sit inside an info banner.
    --
    -- The words differ too ("Buff Filters" vs "Debuff Filters"), so the colour is
    -- redundant reinforcement rather than the only thing distinguishing them -- which
    -- is what keeps a red/green pair legible to a red-green colourblind reader.
    -- ⚠ The red's blue channel sits BELOW its green (47 < 62) and that is the whole
    -- point of the value. The first pass used ffe07a7a, which has G and B identical --
    -- equal G/B is what makes a red read as rose, and it did: "almost pink" (Krathe,
    -- 2026-08-10). Brightening it does not help, it just turns the pink up. Tipping
    -- blue under green is what makes it read as red at this lightness, so if these
    -- are ever retuned, keep B < G rather than raising luminance.

    -- drew a green "Buff" beside a grey "Filters" while the popup -- ONE FontString,
    -- no splitting -- drew the whole phrase green off the identical string.

    --
    -- The information already existed: a See Also footer at the FOOT of the page
    -- listed the same consumer pages. It was doing nothing. This page anchors two
    -- full-height panels, so its footer sits below them and is off-screen on any
    -- normal window -- and it was a static link bar rather than a readout. Same
    -- destinations, moved to where they are seen, and made live.
    --
    -- ⚠ The "not in use" state is the point, not a fallback. A user with no filter
    -- groups reads "Aura Designer -- not in use" and learns that a subsystem the
    -- banner names is not currently involved in anything on their screen. That is
    -- the "what can I safely ignore" answer, and a static link bar can never give
    -- it: a link looks equally important whether or not it leads anywhere.
    --
    -- The chips also carry, by having different counts from different places, the
    -- fact that each consumer chooses its filters somewhere different.
    --
    -- The Defensive Icon has no debuff chip because it has no debuff side: its
    -- selection is buff filters only. That absence is correct and is itself part of
    -- the answer -- do not add a greyed one "for symmetry".

    -- ========== "HOW THIS WORKS" ==========
    -- The one thing banner copy cannot carry: the SHAPE. A sentence can define what
    -- a filter is. It cannot show that three different displays each pick their
    -- filters in a different place, or that Blizzard's debuff categories are a
    -- separate system -- and those two facts are what the page is actually
    -- confusing about.
    --
    -- A labelled LIST rather than drawn art, on purpose: it wraps at any locale
    -- length, needs no textures or layout maths, and carries the same claim. The
    -- addon's singleton alert takes one message string, so the newlines are the
    -- layout.
    --
    -- ⚠ The three destination names are format slots filled from the PAGES' own
    -- L[] strings, not written into the sentence. Rename a page and this follows;
    -- spell one out here and it silently disagrees with the chip next to it.
    --
    -- No buttons table: ShowPopupAlert supplies a single OK when none is given, and
    -- this dialog asks nothing of the reader.
    -- ☠ ".png" IS PART OF THE PATH. Unlike .tga and .blp, whose extension the client
    -- infers, a PNG does not resolve without it -- drop it and this silently renders
    -- nothing. Icons/question.png is the first PNG icon in the addon, shipped
    -- unconverted on purpose to find out how PNG icons behave.
    --
    -- Untinted: the source glyph is #E3E3E3, near enough to the label's own colour
    -- that a SetVertexColor would only be guessing. If it reads dim next to the .tga
    -- icons, the fix is to normalise the ART to white -- a tint multiplies, so it can
    -- darken this glyph but never brighten it.
    --
    -- ⚠ ICON ONLY, so it MUST carry a tooltip: a glyph with no label and no hover
    -- text is a control the reader has to click to identify. StyleButton omits the
    -- label fontstring entirely when no text is passed, and centres the icon.
    -- ☠ A VERB, NOT A HANDLER BODY. Two surfaces open this popup now -- the
    -- island's "?" glyph and the band arm's full-width button inside the
    -- consumers panel -- and a second copy of a five-slot format() is a second
    -- place for the argument order to rot.

    -- resize the window" bug.
    --
    -- ResolvePanelHeight reads banner:GetHeight(). At build the banner is still at
    -- CreateInfoBanner's placeholder SetHeight(opts.minHeight or 34) -- it cannot know
    -- its real height yet, because a FontString's wrap is not resolved until it has
    -- rendered at its final width, so the banner defers its OWN measurement to
    -- C_Timer.After(0, DoRecomputeHeight). This banner runs to four wrapped lines,
    -- so it settles ~50px taller than the placeholder we sized the page against.
    --
    -- Nothing told the page. The spacer kept the build-time total, the page reported
    -- itself ~50px shorter than it drew, and the See Also -- which flows after the
    -- spacer -- landed back on top of the freshness note. Resizing the window was the
    -- ONLY thing that re-ran the arithmetic (the contentFrame OnSizeChanged hook
    -- above), which is exactly why a resize appeared to fix it.
    --
    -- ⚠ The banner's own RecomputeHeight does not help: it ends in RelayoutHost,
    -- which re-flows Add()ed children, and this banner is anchored ABSOLUTELY to the
    -- page child. It is invisible to the layout pass, so its growth reaches nothing.
    --
    -- ⚠ Not a wait-for-it loop and not an OnSizeChanged binding on the banner: that
    -- cascade is the Aura Designer indicator-card lockup documented on
    -- CreateInfoBanner. One deferred pass, matching the banner's own single converge.
    -- Safe to call RefreshStates from here -- SetHTML is idempotent, which is what
    -- stops the refresh -> rebuild -> refresh freeze it guards against.
    --
    -- ⚠ STILL RUN IN THE BAND LAYOUT, and not because the banner needs it there.
    -- An Add()ed banner re-measures into the layout it is in, which is the half this
    -- pass existed for; what the bands still need is the CHIP ROW's wrap and the
    -- freshness note's, both of which are resolved from OnSizeChanged and so are
    -- also a frame late. One deferred pass answers all three.
