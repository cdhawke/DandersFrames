-- control instead -- the cursor is inside the control, so a tooltip outside it
-- can never be under the cursor. The lower half keeps the cursor default, which
-- has the whole screen above it to grow into.

-- invisible frames ... frames out of the screen bounds, making them unclickable".
--
-- ⚠ ONLY A SOLVE WITH NOTHING LEFT ON SCREEN IS TOUCHED. An element seated so
-- that it overhangs an edge keeps its seat exactly; one no part of which can be

-- the consumer applies to its container, so the frames landed off their seat
-- by exactly that offset.

-- (pos.x + dx, pos.y + dy) for the record as given, in UIParent units. Only the
-- consumer can answer it without a stale read, because it knows how its own

-- back here through whatever drives its layout. The guard is what makes that a
-- stop rather than a loop; the epsilon in the sweep is what makes it converge.

-- stay valid for the whole call. A reused scratch table is fine (and is what
-- DandersFrames hands in); rebuilding it from a consumer callback is not.
