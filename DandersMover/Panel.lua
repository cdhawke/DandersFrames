-- ELEMENT PANEL
-- One DandersUI popout per element being edited. The shell (host:CreatePopout)
-- owns the frame, the title bar, the docking, the pin and the tether beam; this
-- file owns what goes INSIDE it and what closing it means.
--
-- ONE PANEL AT A TIME. Every element panel is opened in the family
-- "mover.panel", and a family is an exclusivity CLAIM in the shell: opening one
-- member closes every other, PINNED ONES INCLUDED. So there is never more than
-- one panel on screen -- selecting a mover leaves exactly the pooled popout,
-- following that mover's proxy.
--
-- PIN therefore means "stop following", not "keep a second one". A pinned panel
-- stays where it is and keeps editing ITS mover while the selection is cleared
-- or comes back to it; selecting a DIFFERENT mover closes it (reason "family")
-- and opens a fresh FOLLOWING panel over there. The shell still supports
-- several pinned members for consumers that want them -- the mover does not,
-- because a screen full of panels was never what the editor is for.
--
-- ⚠ Nothing here may read Session.selected inside a control. `build` runs ONCE
-- per instance and every closure it creates belongs to THAT instance, so a
-- control acts on `popout.el` -- the element its own panel is bound to -- which
-- for a pinned panel is not the selected one and never becomes it again.
--
-- Deliberately NOT a settings window. The bulk of the panel is element content
-- -- what this mover is anchored to, where it sits, where it goes.
--
-- Under it sits a SECOND access point for the session verbs (undo, redo, save,
-- discard, settings). The legend strip still carries them, spelled out in
-- words, and is still where they live when nothing is selected; this row is the
-- one you reach for without crossing the screen while you are working on an
-- element. It is a compact ICON row precisely because it is the second copy:
-- five captions would out-shout the content above them, and the strip already
-- says the words.
--
-- ⚠ They are SESSION verbs, so unlike everything else on the panel they do not
-- auto-pin -- pressing Undo is not editing THIS element, and a panel that
-- pinned itself on it would stop following the selection for a keystroke that
-- had nothing to do with the mover it is docked to.
