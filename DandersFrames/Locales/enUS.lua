-- AceLocale silent mode is ALWAYS on by default. AceLocale's default

-- causes spurious errors when external code (BugSack, debug helpers
-- calling :ToDebugString() etc.) introspects our L table — and also
-- fires for any source-build run where translations haven't been pulled.
--
-- To opt back into warnings (useful when developing locally to catch

-- ============================================================
-- ENGLISH SOURCE STRINGS
-- This file serves as the development fallback AND the source
-- for CurseForge localization. At build time, the packager
-- replaces the @localization@ block below with all registered
-- strings from CurseForge.
--
-- To add a new localizable string:
-- 1. Add L["Your String"] = true below (alphabetically)
-- 2. Use L["Your String"] in the code
-- 3. CurseForge discovers it on next build
-- ============================================================

--@localization(locale="enUS", format="lua_additive_table", same-key-is-true=true)@

-- ☠ EMPTY EXPORTS RENDER AS BLANK TEXT. CurseForge auto-discovers new phrases from
-- the uploaded package, and for phrases it picked up that way (as opposed to ones
-- pushed through an enUS import with a real string value) it stores an EMPTY English
-- source text. The packager then writes them out verbatim as L["Key"] = "" -- 790 of
-- them in v5.2.0 -- and since enUS is the baseline every client loads, every settings
-- label among them vanished for everyone (field report, 2026-08-17: "some texts in
-- menus are missing"). AceLocale's key-fallback only fires for keys that are ABSENT,
-- so an empty string sails straight through to SetText.
-- Sweep the app table right here, before any other file reads L at file scope: an
-- empty value is never a legitimate translation, so it reverts to the key. The
-- portal-side fix (an enUS import so the English text is really stored) is separate;
-- this makes the addon immune to the export regardless.

-- FILTER MEMBERSHIP
-- No strings here, and that is the answer rather than an omission. A buff
-- filter's spell rows spent four rounds hunting for a verb — Enable/Disable,
-- Included/Excluded, Tracked/Untracked, and a checkbox on the row's left — and
-- what they landed on was a checkbox in the row's RIGHT-hand control slot, which
-- needs no verb at all.
--   * Enable/Disable claimed authority the control lacks (the filter may be off).
--   * Included/Excluded disagreed with the header count.
--   * Tracked/Untracked was accurate but needed an 80px button on sixty rows.
--   * Show/Hide and Show/Skip belong to the BLACKLIST, which keeps them.
--   * On/Off is the FILTER switch's vocabulary, in the left list and status line.
--   * A box on the LEFT put every heavy element on one side of the row.
-- "tracked" survives once, as a noun, in the header count below.

-- and read as though the filter were off in both. %s is a comma-joined list, so

-- ☠ A USED-BY readout, not a switch readout. It opened with the filter's own on/off

-- page, so there is no single "on" to report and the honest question is which
-- consumers are using this filter right now. All three are equals in the list — the

-- label — the labelled button was 128px of a row whose three chips need the width

-- Carries the DEFINITION in the em-dash appositive. The predecessor was this same
-- sentence without it ("This page designs BUFF filters."), which names the activity
-- to someone who does not yet know what the noun is -- the reader has to already

-- Power Infusion Helper — its OWN page as of 2026-09-08 (Auras > Power Infusion Helper,

-- and the removal caption that went with them are gone rather than left for translators to
-- work on text nobody will ever see.
--
-- The page's NAV ENTRY. Title case, because nav labels are title case everywhere in this

-- where case is not a presentation choice a transform is wrong in both places.

L["Shows who is worth infusing, and goes dark while your Power Infusion is on cooldown."] = true
-- ⚠ The helper's surface menu reuses the addon's existing L["Square"] and the frame-level
-- labels; it needs no names of its own. It briefly had a "Power Infusion icon" string when
-- Icon was the surviving placed surface -- that was reversed the same afternoon (the helper
-- highlights that someone popped a cooldown; it does not track WHICH one, so a per-buff
-- icon promised detail the feature never delivers) and the string went with it.
-- ★★ THE PANEL'S TWO HALVES, in the order the feature is reasoned about: decide what COUNTS
-- as worth infusing, then decide how it gets SHOWN. "What to Show" was the old heading for
-- the second half and led the panel -- the answer before the question -- which is why it read
-- as a pile of settings. Retired 2026-09-08 along with "Never Show On", whose two role ticks
-- are inside Triggers now.
-- ⚠ "Triggers" is this panel's own heading and needs no qualifier: the page it lives on is
-- already named Power Infusion Helper. L["Indicators"] is the addon's existing key, reused.
L["Triggers"] = true
-- ★ The Effects tab's add row, and the per-effect remove beside each one. A signal can hold
-- several surfaces now (border AND health bar AND a square), so both of these repeat.
-- ⚠ "Remove %s" TAKES THE SURFACE'S OWN NAME -- "Remove Border", "Remove Health Bar" -- and
-- that is not decoration: with several effects listed, a bare "Remove" would sit beside three
-- rows looking identical and the user could not tell which one it acted on.
-- ☠ THE HELPER'S PRIVATE EFFECTS TAB IS GONE (2026-09-09) AND SEVEN KEYS WENT WITH IT:
-- its own "ADD AN EFFECT" heading, the two route cards that asked WHICH SIGNAL, their
-- descriptions, its empty-state line, and the surface dropdown's swap label. The Effects
-- tab is the DESIGNER'S now -- same heading, same tiles, same effect cards -- and there is
-- no signal to choose: everything added is "worth infusing".
-- Clash warnings. Shown only on the three surfaces that take a single winner, and each names
-- the remedy that already exists rather than describing the problem.
-- The offender is NAMED: "something else colours the border" sends someone hunting through
-- their own effects list, where a name turns the warning into an instruction. %s is that name,
-- or the "%s and %d more" form when several contend.
-- The second %s is L["Give this aura its own border"] -- the checkbox's own label key rides
-- as a placeholder so a translator renders it once and the sentence can never drift from the
-- control it points at.
L["%s already colours the border. Only one can show — tick '%s' on one of them, or move this signal somewhere else."] = true
L["%s already colours this text. Only one can show — raise this signal's priority, or move it somewhere else."] = true
L["%s and %d more"] = true
L["Another effect"] = true
-- Shared settings. These live on the helper, not on each effect: they are statements about
-- who you would infuse, and there is only one answer per player. They sit on the Triggers TAB
-- -- excluding a role is a statement about what counts, not about how it is drawn -- so the
-- old "Never Show On" heading went with the regroup.
-- ⚠ THE BOX IS "Roles" AND THE TAB IS "Triggers" (Krathe, 2026-09-09). It was Triggers for
-- both, so the tab opened with a box repeating its own name -- which says nothing, while the
-- thing it could have said (this box is the ROLE filter) went unsaid.
L["Roles"] = true
L["Groups without assigned roles show everyone."] = true
-- ★★ THE NAMED-PLAYER ALLOWLIST. "In guild groups it would be useful to only have the PI
-- alert for the DPS you know who should be getting PI instead of every DPS in the raid who
-- uses a CD" (Krathe, 2026-09-10).
-- ☠ THE NOTE IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT DECORATION. Every other control on this tab narrows by being
-- ticked ON; this one narrows by having anything in it AT ALL -- so an empty picker looks like
-- a filter that has been switched off when it means the exact opposite. One sentence is the
-- difference between a default and an apparent fault.
L["Players"] = true
-- ★★ THE COOLDOWN-ICON GROUP'S OWN SOURCES. Krathe, 2026-09-10: "we should let people
-- toggle cooldowns and the sub filters on/off so they can pick from any of the 4... it might
-- be the case they want to trigger from a trinket but only show a CD etc." Triggers answers
-- WHEN the helper fires; this answers WHAT the row of icons then shows.
-- ⚠ THE FOOTER IS A STATE READOUT, NOT A CAPTION. Four ticks matching the Triggers tab look
-- identical whether they are INHERITING it or were set by hand to the same thing, and the
-- difference is whether a later change over there still reaches this group. So one line says
-- which, and the button is the way back to following.
-- L["Show"], L["Trinkets"], L["Potions"], L["Racials"] and L["Class Cooldowns"] are reused.
L["SHOW"] = true
L["Class Cooldowns"] = true
L["Following the Triggers tab. Changing one of these stops that."] = true
L["Follow Triggers"] = true
-- ★★ THE ALLOWLIST'S OWN SWITCH (2026-09-11), and the note shrank to make room for it.
-- ⚠ RETIRED: L["Empty means everyone. Add players here to watch only them."]. Its first
-- sentence described a rule that has moved into the tick's tooltip, where it belongs now that
-- emptiness is no longer what decides anything.
-- ⚠ "ONLY WATCH THESE PLAYERS" reads correctly in both positions -- ticked it is the rule,
-- unticked it is the rule you are not using -- which a label like "Use player list" does not:
-- that one names a mechanism and leaves the reader to work out its effect.
L["Add players here to watch only them."] = true
L["Only watch these players"] = true
-- ⚠ OFF FIRST, because off is the state this switch was asked for: Krathe, 2026-09-11, wants
-- to keep a raid team written down and stop applying it on a pug night. The promise that the
-- list survives is the whole point, so it is the sentence that leads.
-- ⚠ THE EMPTY-LIST RULE SITS ON THE ON LINE, which is the only state it can apply in.
L["Off: the helper watches everyone. Your list is kept for next time."] = true
L["On: only the players listed below. An empty list still means everyone."] = true
-- The compact picker's row button, which toggles. Both states are spelled out because the
-- glyph alone (a chevron, or a tick) says which state you are IN and not what a click does.
L["Click to watch this player."] = true
L["Click to stop watching this player."] = true
-- ⚠ ASKED POSITIVELY, like every other tick on the panel. It was "Hide the helper while your
-- Power Infusion is on cooldown" -- the one control in a box of enables that turned a
-- SUPPRESSION on, which made the box read inconsistently. The stored value is unchanged and
-- still defaults to gating, so this ships UNTICKED and nobody's saved choice changed meaning.
-- ⚠ ...AND THEN SHORTENED. It spelled the whole rule out on the row and wrapped doing it;
-- the rule moved to the tooltip below. What the LABEL has to carry is WHICH cooldown is meant
-- -- this box is otherwise full of other people's -- so it names the spell outright, where
-- "Show while on cooldown" would have read as the tracked one. Krathe's wording, verbatim,
-- capital C included: a label he typed is a label he can find again.
L["Show when Power Infusion is on Cooldown"] = true
-- ⚠ "EFFECTS", NOT "MARKERS". This panel's own word is the one the Effects tab and ACTIVE
-- INDICATORS use; "marker" belongs to the raid target icon and the dispel corner mark, which
-- are other features. Krathe, 2026-09-10: "markers? it should be effects and the wording
-- itself is not very clear on the tooltip rethink it."
-- ⚠ ONE LINE PER STATE, each a plain sentence, off first because off is the default. What
-- these replace stated a consequence of the rule ("so you are never pointed at someone you
-- cannot infuse") before finishing the rule itself.
-- ⚠ The label says "on Cooldown", so these say "off cooldown" / "on cooldown" back rather
-- than reaching for "ready" -- one idea, one word for it.
L["Off: the helper's effects only appear while your Power Infusion is off cooldown."] = true
L["On: they appear even while it is on cooldown."] = true
-- ★ SHOW IN COMBAT ONLY, beside the cooldown gate and independent of it: both conditions
-- have to pass, and the tooltip says so rather than leaving the reader to work out how two
-- conditions on one feature combine. Off first, as above, because off is the default.
L["Off: the helper works wherever you are."] = true
L["On: nothing shows until you are in combat. Independent of the cooldown setting above -- both have to pass."] = true
-- Only watch. Classes rather than specs because the spell data records a class and nothing
-- finer; the row links out to the editor that does go spell by spell, so the limit is not
-- a dead end.
-- ★ THE BASELINE BOX: the class ticks, the note, and the button that edits the list they
-- narrow. Its count rides the header because the source has no row of its own.
L["Classes and Cooldowns"] = true
-- ⚠ A BUTTON, NOT A PENCIL. The pencils sit on the Additional Filters ROWS, beside the
-- tick that includes each source; this box has no source row -- the class ticks are the
-- control -- so a full-width button reads as belonging to the box rather than to whichever
-- row it happened to be nearest. Krathe, 2026-09-10.
L["Edit Cooldowns"] = true
L["Classes"] = true
L["Untick a class to stop watching its cooldowns."] = true
-- Sound. The helper owns this entry outright: the generic effects list refuses to show sound
-- on a filter-owned record, so it offers no row and no delete button for it either.
-- ⚠ THE TICK IS LABELLED "Enable" AND EXPLAINS ITSELF IN A TOOLTIP. Its label was the whole
-- sentence below, under a box already captioned Sound Alert -- the feature stated twice, and
-- wrapping to two lines to do it. Krathe: "too verbose, make it Enable with a tooltip
-- explaining what it does in better english." L["Enable"] and L["Sound Alert"] already exist.
L["Plays your chosen sound when a group member's cooldown makes them worth infusing."] = true
L["Only plays while the helper is showing."] = true
-- Show When Missing's greyed-out reason on a helper effect (Indicators.lua GateSWM): the
-- missing-mode render path is the one place the helper's cooldown gate cannot reach.
L["Not available on a Power Infusion Helper signal."] = true
-- ★ THE FOUR TRIGGER SOURCES, one row each with its count and a link to its own list.
-- ⚠ THE ROWS REPLACED A SINGLE BUTTON AND A NOTE explaining that three of the four were
-- not really editable -- Krathe: "the note below the link to edit the cooldown list is
-- silly, the additional filters can also be edited, this really is an unclear mess." They
-- ARE editable now (pihAmplifierIDs honours each preset's ticks and the copy is re-taken
-- on every visit), so each row simply offers the way in and the panel says nothing.
-- ⚠ THE FOURTH SOURCE IS NOT HERE. Class cooldowns live in the "Classes and Cooldowns"
-- box with the ticks that narrow them and the button that edits them -- that box is the
-- baseline, and these three are what you add to it.
-- ⚠ The counts are appended to these labels at render time and need no translating.

-- The three sources in Additional Filters. Each tick puts that source's spells into the ONE

-- the class ticks are its control, so it is named by the "Classes and Cooldowns" header
-- instead. See P.PIH_CooldownCounts for why a tick there was redundant AND harmful.

-- The helper's add block, which stands where the designer's three scope cards stand on every

-- ⚠ THE ICON TILE NEEDS ITS OWN DESCRIPTION. The shared one reads "The spell's own artwork",
-- which is true in the designer and false here. Its key is gone: the answer stopped being
-- "pinned to Power Infusion" the moment the tile grew a second step, and it is now the
-- three-way description a few lines down.
-- ★ THE HELPER'S ADD GRID. Two steps for the icon -- which KIND of indicator, then which
-- ICON -- because the three icon answers are as different from each other as an icon is from
-- a square, and every other choice on that grid is made by looking at a thumbnail.
-- ★★ THREE ANSWERS BEHIND ONE TILE, on two axes: HOW MANY (one effect, or one per
-- cooldown they have up) and WHAT PICTURE (always Power Infusion, or the buff they used).
-- "Cooldown Icons" is the GROUP and used to stand on the main grid beside Border and Square,
-- which put a container among a row of effects -- see pihBuildAddTiles for why that mismatch
-- is what made it confusing rather than merely untidy.

-- ⚠ THE SECOND LINE OF A GREYED TILE'S TOOLTIP, and it has to say where the thing WENT --
-- these tiles are greyed rather than removed precisely because a tile that vanished when you
-- clicked it told nobody anything.
-- ⚠ ONE MESSAGE FOR ALL THREE. The two single-icon tiles briefly shared a different one
-- ("the card below switches which picture it shows") because adding either spent both; they
-- are two independent effects now -- Krathe asked for the pair -- so each greys on its own and
-- the honest instruction is the same as the group's: remove it from the list below.
L["Already added. Remove it from the list below to change it."] = true
-- The cooldown-icon group's collapsed summary, in place of the filter count every other group
-- shows. Its list is the cooldown list, which the Triggers tab owns -- so trinkets, potions
-- and racials reach it automatically as they are ticked there, with no second control here
-- that could disagree. The number is the list's own enabled total, so it moves when they do.
L["%d spells, from your Triggers"] = true
-- ⚠ AND THE PLAIN COUNT, for a group that has been given its own SHOW set. Saying "from your
-- Triggers" on a group that no longer follows them would be the header contradicting the block

-- ★ THE ICON'S TWO CHOICES on the Power Infusion Helper's pool. The picture is pinned to
-- Power Infusion by default -- "infuse this player" -- and can be swapped for the buff they
-- actually used. The caveat in the first tooltip is real and not a hedge: a placed icon
-- renders ONE slot, so with a cooldown and a trinket up together the engine's pick is not
-- ours to make. The second tick is the answer to that, and names the case it is for.
L["Show the triggering cooldown's icon"] = true
L["Off: the Power Infusion icon, on everyone worth infusing. On: the buff they actually used — one of them, if several are up at once."] = true
-- ★★ THE ICON'S FOUR SOURCES, matching the Cooldown Icons group's SHOW block. These replace
-- one tick ("Ignore trinkets, potions and racials") that muted all three amplifiers at once:
-- same mechanism, per source. Krathe, 2026-09-10: "yes build the icon block the same".
-- ⚠ SUBTRACTIVE, AND THE FOOTER SAYS SO. A placed effect is keyed by ONE filter reference,
-- so it can show less than Triggers watches and never more -- showing more needs a filter of
-- its own, which is what the group is for. A source Triggers has off is GREYED rather than
-- hidden, with its own reason, or the two cards would disagree about how many sources exist.
-- L["Class Cooldowns"], L["Trinkets"], L["Potions"] and L["Racials"] are reused.

-- so since the pair became addable at once, two rows in ACTIVE INDICATORS read identically.
